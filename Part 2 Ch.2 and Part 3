<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p><center>The Change of Lead at the Gallop.</center></p>

<p>This movement is to be undertaken when the horse is capable of taking the desired lead from a trot on a straight line.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put the horse on a circle of large radius, at a galiop. Leave the circle by a line parallel to the diagonal of the riding-hall and form another large circle to the opposite hand, keeping the same lead at the gallop as on the first circle. Galloping on the second circle with the same lead as on the first is galloping "false." Besides lowering the croup and balancing the horse, the false lead impresses the aids upon the horse, because to maintain a false lead the aids used- on the first circle must be more strongly used on the second.</li>
  <li>Gallop the horse on a straight line, leading right. Bring him down to a trot, previously having changed the aids to gallop left, which assists in bringing the horse to the trot and prepares the way for the next move. As soon as the trot is taken, increase the aids of gallop left, increase the impulsion, and send the horse into gallop left, with only a few steps of the trot intervening be-tween gallops. Gradually, as the horse becomes proficient, decrease the number of steps taken at the trot.</li>
  <li>When the amount of trot required between changes of lead is hardly more than a slackening of speed, or "half halt," make a large circle to the right at the gallop, leading right. Leave the circle on the diag-onal, as before, and make another circle to the left, hold-ing the right lead. Change the aids, while on the second circle, to gallop left, without coming to the trot, and force the horse into the change of lead.</li>
  <li>When the horse can accomplish the above, at-tempt the change of aids and force the change of lead on the straight line without diminishing the gait.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above movements are very difficult to accom-plish smoothly and correctly. The change of aids must not be accomplished roughly and the aids must be used with only the intensity required to change the lead, there-by not forcing the horse to increase of speed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<center>Jumping.</center>

<p>Jumping is an exercise which when properly under-taken is most instructive and productive of good results to both man and horse.</p>

<center>Mechanism of the Jump for Height.</center>

<center>(Jumping from the Gallop Left.)</center>

<ol>
  <li>As the left fore foot is about to leave the ground, just before the moment of suspension of the gallop, the leg, especially the fetlock joint, is straightened.</li>
  <li>The head and neck are elevated. The above movement raises the forehand.</li>
  <li>Just as the left foot is raised the two hind legs are brought up to a place on the ground about where the left fore foot was.</li>
  <li>The hind legs are straightened out. Due to the last movement, the horse completely
leaves the ground and takes the obstacle, with fore and hind legs bent.</li>
  <li>The horse lands on the left fore foot, legs straight.</li>
  <li>The right fore foot, leg straight, is then brought to the support.</li>
  <li>The left fore foot is picked up.</li>
  <li>The right fore foot is picked up and simulta-neously the left hind comes to the ground.</li>
  <li>The right hind comes to the ground. The horse then is galloping right after landing. </li>
</ol>

<p>The horse leaps from a trot from one front leg and both hind legs. The leap is more difficult, as it is impossible at a trot to get both hind legs side by side up under the body to &#8243;take of.&#8243;</p>

<p>From the walk and halt, the horse in jumping first rears, then straightens out his hind legs.</p>

<p>As jumping for height at a gallop is the easiest for a horse, and as the principles encountered apply equally well to the other gaits, the following deductions are made from the mechanism at the gallop, as explained in previous paragraphs:</p>

<p>From Paragraph i : As the distance from the jump to the place where the left leg leaves the ground is of the utmost importance to the horse, he should be allowed to gauge his stride while approaching the jump.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 2: As the head and neck are raised to assist in raising the fore quarters, the rider's body should not lean forward of the perpendicular, for this would hinder the movement. As the horse's object is to lighten the fore quarters, it follows that great speed is a detriment to a horse in jumping, for the more speed the more weight upon the forehand. Raising the head and neck necessitates lengthening the reins at the moment of extension, or letting them slide through the fingers. It follows then, that, as a false movement of the hand with a severe bit causes greater injury than one with a snaffle bit, a snaffle bit should be used in jumping until proficiency is obtained.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 3 : To facilitate the bringing well up under the body of the hind leg, the rider's legs must be carried back.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 5 : The weight of the rider's body must set to the rear to assist the horse by lightening the load on the forehand while landing. If a severe bit or a hard hand pulls the head in and bends the neck while the horse is in this position, by cramping the muscles of the neck the horse is prevented from stretching his legs to the front to insure a safe landing.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 7: If the rider's weight is forward or he is thrown upon the horse's neck while the horse is landing, the extra weight on the forehand prevents the fore leg being picked up and causes over-reaching. Ex-treme speed has the same effect with the same result.</p>

<p>From Paragraphs 8 and 9: It is seen that the horse is galloping with the other lead after landing. In jump-ing in the riding-hall care should be exercised at the cor-ner beyond the jump if at the gallop, for, if galloping correctly at the start, the horse is galloping false after the jump.</p>

<p><em>Teaching the Horse to Jump.--</em>Place a bar upon the ground and lead the horse over it at a walk. When the horse executes this movement correctly, raise the bar to about two feet and jump the horse upon the longe.</p>

<p><em>To Jump a Horse on the Longe.--</em>First instruct the horse sufficiently upon the longe until he goes equally well on either hand. Approach the jump, the horse cir-cling on the longe on the left hand, for instance. The trainer holds the longe in the left hand so that it can be allowed to run out with ease; the longeing-whip is held in the right hand. Circle the horse near the jump until the horse goes quietly. The circles are made slightly in rear of the jump. When the horse is quiet, move so that the jump will intercept the circle the horse is making. As the horse approaches the jump the trainer, with the longe fairly taut, likewise approaches the end of the bar nearest him, keeping the longeing-whip held in rear of the horse. Urge the horse with the whip, if necessary, until lie jumps. After taking off, let the longe run through the ringers so as not to yank the horse or bring him up short. When the horse does well, stop him and caress him or give him carrots or oats.</p>

<p>Jumping should be begun at first at the walk, then at the trot and gallop. The horse jumping for the first time gauges his stride more easily at the walk.</p>

<p>A bar may be placed two or three feet from the ground in the opening of the corral fence, etc., so that the horses that have been worked at jumping on the longe may be thus intercepted by an easy jump on their way to the corral or to some such place to which they are desirous of going. A man with a longeing whip stands ready to urge on any that refuse. This jump should be stiff and helps to prepare horses for outdoor jumping.</p>

<p><em>Riding the Horse Over the Jump.--</em>The horse being able to jump with sufficient accuracy, on the longe, is mounted. First, he is ridden over the bar on the ground. Then over the bar gradually raised to suit the horse.</p>

<p>On taking a horse up to the jump the following are essential points to remember:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rider must make up his mind that he is going to make the horse jump.</li>
  <li>He must have confidence in his balance and not stiffen his muscles.</li>
  <li>He must increase the grip with his knees and the calves of his legs and keep his hands low.</li>
  <li>The rider must have the horse well in hand and must remember that if a horse attempts to slip out to the left, the use of the right rein, to turn the head to the right, helps the horse to go to the left by freeing the left shoulder. The rein of support is the one which should be used, together with whichever leg will straighten the horse so that he is perpendicular to his jump.</li>
</ol>

<p>Horses are more easily controlled in the riding-hall, but jump with more freedom outdoors. Outdoor jumping should be taken up as soon as the horse learns to jump moderately well indoors.</p>

<p>Jumping for Breadth. Ã¢ This is a more difficult jump to teach a new horse, because he is more fearful of a ditch than of a fence. From the nature of the jump, it can only be taught outdoors. The method of instruction is the same as for jumping for height.</p>

<p>As the momentum acquired by speed is essential to carry the horse's body across an open ditch, greater speed is necessary than in jumping for height. Excessive speed, however, so weights down the forehand that it becomes difficult for the horse to raise his forehand sufficiently to clear the ditch.</p>
