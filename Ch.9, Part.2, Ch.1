<h2>PART II</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<h4>The Double Bridle.</h4>

<p>The horse that can perform successfully the fore-
going exercises, that has found his balance while moving
forward, that is easy to control by the aids at the walk
and trot, and that has learned the use of his legs in ac-
complishing a good walk, trot, and gallop, is ready for
the double bridle. It normally takes about three months
to accomplish this.</p>

<p><em>Definition.</em> &mdash; The double bridle is one with usually
four cheek straps, which fasten, one into the eye of the
curb bit, the other into the ring of the snaffle bit.</p>

<p>The curb bit is nearer the front of the horse's mouth
than the snaffle, and the curb chain likewise passes in
front of the snaffle bit.</p>


<p><em>The Severity of the Curb Bit Increases &mdash; </em></p>
<ol>
<li> With the difference between the length of the
upper and lower branches.</li>

<li> With the tightness of the curb chain.</li>

<li> With the height of the port.</li>

<li> Inversely With the size of the canons. <em>(De
Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>

</ol>

<p>Bits with branches similar in length to the U. S. rej-
ulation bit are arranged below in order of mildness:</p>

<ol>

<li> The broken curb bit. (Like a snaffle bit, but
with upper and lower branches and curb chain.)</li>

<li> Rubber- and leather-covered bits.</li>

<li> The straight bar bit.</li>

<li> The regulation bit. </li>

</ol>

<p><em>Kinds.</em> &mdash; The "Weymouth" or "Pump" bit is quite
universally used for polo. Why it is considered effica-
cious for polo especially is not known. It is a good bit,
except the lips are liable to become pinched.</p>

<p>The "Pelham" is a bit provided with rings for the
snaffle rein at the junction of the canon with the branch-
es. The action of the curb reins on this bit does not
produce the same effect, when the snaffle reins are used
at the same time, as it does on a curb bit, where the snaf-
fle reins are attached to a separate snaffle bit.</p>

<p>It is a general rule to follow, that all complicated
bits are useless, and that with a well-trained horse the
mildest bit that will insure obedience is the correct one.</p>

<h3>Schedule for Accustoming the Horse to the
Curb Bit.</h3>

<p>The reins are held in both hands, snaffle reins out-
side the little fingers.</p>
<ol>

<li> Use the curb bit without curb chain until the
horse becomes accustomed to it.</li>

<li>Use the mildest bit available and fasten the curb
chain loosely. At first, only move on straight lines until
the horse takes the bit quietly, then execute simple ex-
ercises in which the horse is proficient. These exercises
at first are begun on the snaffle bit.</li>

<li>Use the bit best adapted to the horse, and set
the curb chain to keep the bit from falling through.</li>

</ol>

<p>Work mainly on the snaffle bit until the horse becomes
accustomed to the bit and curb chain.</p>

<p>The preceding movements should be begun at first
at a slow gait.</p>

<p><em>Use.</em> â€” The curb bit is used primarily, in training, to
lower the head, to flex the jaw, and to bring the nose in
towards the body.</p>

<p>The snaffle bit raises the head and supports the horse.</p>

<p>A curb bit will not stop a horse that makes up his to bolt.</p>

<p>A curb bit roughly used may cause a horse to make
up his mind to bolt.</p>

<p>A "hard mouth" is often a tender mouth accustomed
to hard hands.</p>

<p><em>The Curb Bit ''Gathers'' the Horse.</em> &mdash; A horse is
gathered when his head and neck are well raised, the
front line of the face nearly vertical, and the jaw and
the junction of the head and neck at the poll flexible.</p>

<p>A horse in a state of "collection" is in a position to
obey, to the utmost of his capability, any demands the aids
may give.</p>


<p>A horse is in "collection" when he is gathered and
his hind legs are well up under the body.</p>

<p>When a horse is collected, the rider, by having omit-
ted bending the neck near the shoulders during training,
has the neck firm on the shoulders and not flexible or
"rubber-necked." Hence the rider acts on the neck
through the mouth and on the shoulders through the
neck. The hind quarters by being under the horse bind
themselves to the forehand. The rider then by acting
on the forehand acts likewise upon the hind quarters.</p>

<p>The entire body of the horse should be, if properly
collected, an energetic and harmonious whole. The
horse is "in hand," because his jaw is flexible and he
yields to the effects of the bit. The horse is light or
handy, because he is balanced by continual training and
because his center of gravity is equally near both front
and hind quarters; hence the proper movement on the
part of the rider will disturb this balance in any direc-
tion desired.</p>

<p>The rider at this point, being supposed to be able to
get the hind legs up under the horse, must learn to gath-
er him.</p>


<p>To gather the horse involves:</p>
<ol>

<li> Direct flexion (the flexion of the jaw and head
in the direction of the axis of the horse).</li>

<li> Lateral flexion (the flexion of the neck at the
poll in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the horse).</li>

</ol>
<p> <em>Direct Flexion.</em> &mdash; Direct flexion is the concession the
head and lower jaw of the horse make in the vertical
plane of the axis of the horse when the action of the
reins arrest the extension of the neck. The giving of the
neck is confined to the upper portion; the front line of
the face is made to approach a vertical line and the head
is made to make in an almost imperceptible manner a
movement analogous to a nod. </p>

<p>The giving of the jaw consists in opening the mouth,
causing complete abandon of the bit, followed immediate
ly by the closing of the mouth and the taking up of con-
tact with the bit again.</p>

<p>To flex the jaw in direct flexion, first start the horse
into a walk. Never let the gait slacken during flexion.
Close the legs. When the horse goes up into the bit,
close one hand on one snaffle rein I if the movement is
done with a snaffle bit), or close the hand on both curb
reins. Do not make the pressure of long duration if re-
sistance is encountered. Alternate the action, first by
releasing, then increasing the pressure. This is more
uncomfortable to the horse than continued pressure, and
he will soon yield.</p>

<p>The head is flexed in direct flexion so that it is set
with the front line of the face nearly vertical by the action
of both curb reins. The head and neck are raised by the
snaffle bit, should they be lowered too much.</p>

<p><em>Lateral Flexion.</em> &mdash; Lateral flexion is a concession
which the head and neck make by turning the head to
the right or to the left when an opposing action of the
reins stops an extension of the neck. The jaw gives
in lateral flexion as in direct flexion. The neck gives by
making the head make a turn of a quarter of a circle to
the right or left at the poll.</p>

<p>Lateral flexion should be demanded, in the begin-
ning, at the walk. To obtain it, to the right, for exam-
ple: first, resistance must be offered by the right direct
rein, which leads the head into the desired position; the
left rein then acts to limit this movement and to work
together with the right rein to obtain the concession oi
the jaw.</p>

<p>Flexion may be made dismounted, if absolutely im-
possible of execution mounted.</p>

<p><em>Direct Flexion Dismounted. </em> &mdash; Stand on the near side
of the horse. Take the snaffle reins off the neck over
the horse's head and hold them a few inches in front of
his head with the left hand. Urge the horse forward
into a walk and raise the head sightly to the proper ele-
vation with the snaffle reins : When the horse moves out
at the walk, take the curb reins in the right hand and as-
similate the movement of the reins as though flexing the
jaw mounted. Do not let the horse slacken speed or, at
any cost, back up.</p>

<p><em>Lateral Flexion Dismounted. </em> &mdash; Stand on the near
side, with the snaffle rein held as for direct flexion. Ex-
ecute direct flexion and when performed lead the horse's
head to the right with a snaffle rein, increasing the pres-
sure of the right curb rein slightly until the head is turned
to the right at the poll. Do not let the horse move back-
ward, nor let the neck flex in rear of the poll. The max-
imum movement of the head is over an arc of a circle
of 90 degrees.</p>
