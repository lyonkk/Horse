<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>TriK Forward Movement.</h3>

<p>The horses being now able to be mounted, the fol-
lowing exercises may be undertaken:</p>

<p>The horses are taken into the riding-hall, if available,
and the riders instructed to work without regard to dis-
tances. It is a bad plan to work in groups, especially
with young horses, as they soon become accustomed to
remaining in ranks and refuse to leave.</p>

<p>The forward movement, as has been stated, is the
most important lesson in training, and it is continually
taught during the entire course of instruction.</p>

<p>The Walk. — To take the walk from the halt, both
legs should be made to be felt, gradually increasing their
intensity until the setting in motion is produced. The
fingers and wrists give, to allow the neck to stretch out.
The horse should be set in motion in the direction of his</p>

<hr />

<p>axis by symmetrical use of the aids. The movement
should be smooth, but without hesitancy.</p>

<p>In order to keep the start from being sudden, the
energy displayed in the use of the leg should conform to
the degree of sensitiveness of the horse. The movement
can be kept from being hesitatingly performed by pro-
gressively, but without hesitancy, using such force as the
legs should have, and by giving the reins with the fingers
and wrist at the precise moment the neck tries to
stretch out.</p>

<p><em>The Trot. —</em> This is the most advantageous gait to
take during the first lessons, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It starts the horse straight ahead and helps to
bring him in hand.</li>
  <li>'Horses are less restless at this gait.</li>
  <li>It is a natural pace.</li>
  <li>It is a good suppling exercise for the horse.
The trot is not a fatiguing pace to the horse. He
can go a long distance continuously at a fair rate of
speed at this gait, because both fore and hind legs, re-
spectively, have the same amount of work to do, and the
body can be easily maintained in a state of equilibrium,
as it is supported by diagonal supports.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rider, if in the flat saddle, except at slow gaits,
should rise to the trot during this exercise. The diag-
onal on which the rise is made should frequently be
changed.</p>

<p>The lightness of the horse only comes with further
training. The rider up to this point tries little by lit-
tle to bring the horse under control by the following
exercises :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moving to the front at a walk, then a trot.</li>
  <li>Increasing and decreasing gaits.</li>
  <li>Halting.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To Halt. —</em> To execute this movement, lean back
slightly and gradually increase the pressure of the bit
on the mouth until the movement slows down and grad-
ually steps. Roth legs should at the same time be carried
back to assist the horse in bringing the haunches up under
him. The horse should neither raise nor lower his head.
The whole mass of the neck should move toward the
withers.</p>

<hr />

<p>Halting the horse should often be practiced with
horses posse- sing a high, powerful croup and with those
inclined to forge ahead at all times. Those inclined to
fret, those whose legs are well set up under them, and
those that are difficult to keep up into the bit should sel-
dom be halted.</p>

<p>Especially during these lessons must the rider pay
strict attention to the even tension of the rein. At first
the rider must do all the work — that is, must tighten the
reins; but later, the horse having become accustomed to
the pressure of the bit and always having the idea of go-
ing straight ahead, will of his own accord keep the reins
taut.</p>

<p><em>The Gallop. —</em> Almost invariably the gallop lesson
should be begun early. This is an additional means of
suppling the horse, of strengthening him, extending him,
and pushing him straight ahead. It would be stupidity
to gallop frequently on a colt that drags his legs and is
disunited at a trot and that has difficulty in holding up
the part essential to the training. On the other hand,
it is proper to gallop repeatedly on a vigorous horse that
has been worked before purchase, or on the horse with
good strong legs, particularly after he has been thorough-
ly confirmed in the correct trot. <i>(Notes cf Equitation.)</i></p>

<p><em>To Take the Gallop by Extending the Trot. —</em> To ac-
complish this movement, the rider needs only to take the
trot and by the use of both legs to push this gait up to
the point where the horse leaves it to pass into the gallop.</p>

<p>To accomplish this without undue increase of speed,
put the horse on a circle of six or seven yards radius,
first trot around this and then lengthen the trot until the
horse escapes into the gallop. When he is calm and the
rider feels confidence in himself, the rider may leave the
circle and rejoin the track on the same hand.</p>

<p>As long as the rider does not wish to make abrupt
changes of direction, but gallops on a large circle or on
the track, it makes little difference whether the horse is
galloping true or false, and it is useless for the rider to
bother about the leads at this stage of the training. <i>(Dc
Saint-Phalle.)</i></p>

<p>When the horse begins to understand the gallop and
lakes it calmK, the correct lead, which is explained on
page 61, may be undertaken, at present, by the following
aids : Both legs to increase the gait from the trot to the
gallop ; outside rein to prevent the haunches from swing-
ing to the outside and which precludes the liability to a
false lead.</p>

<p><em>(Note. — "Outside" always means the outside of a
circle, or, if on the track, the side towards the wall.)</em></p>
