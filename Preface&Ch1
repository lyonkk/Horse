<h1 class"center-ok"> FOREWORD. </h1>

<p>The object of this book is to arrange in the most convenient, clear and concise form the modern system of horse training, in so far as it is applicable to the training of horses in the mounted service of the United States &mdash; no attempt has been made in any case to improve upon methods already deemed correct by the best horse-men; and as such methods can be found dealing with all points of training, it follows that the subject matter in this book is not original. Where the best was to be found, there it has been sought, and where the authors of previous works have expressed their ideas in language considered the most concise and clear, their words have been copied verbatim, with due acknowledgement to the authors.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the following for methods, theories, translation of technical terms, and improvised commands herein contained:</p>
<p class="indent">To Major George H. Cameron, 14th Cavalry, Captain W. C. Short, 13th Cavalry, 3

Jones, 10th Cavalry, for valuable assistance and advice. </p>

<p><strong> PREFACE </strong> </p>
Nothing within this book is believed to be beyond the reach of the mounted service in <strong> general </strong>.
The time allotted to "breaking" or gentling will be in many cases eliminated, as the present system of remount stations has become well established.

<p>Each troop should have three or four such articles as longes and cavessons. These articles can be made very easily by saddlers and blacksmiths, from a model. Models can undoubtedly be procured through the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, or from any saddlery store, care being taken in purchasing from the latter to determine whether the model is a correct one or not.</p>
<p>In many cases the reasons for the use of certain aids, etc., are apparent, and all explanation is omitted. In other cases, where explanations involve nice points of mechanics, etc., they have likewise been omitted. The reason for the latter omissions being, that they are interesting to the student only.</p>



<p> The real student of horse training can only be one who enjoys such work. Many officers do not enjoy it, and this book is intended for all.
In view of the fact that all the methods embodied herein are well&mdash;recognized methods, I trust readers will take for granted that they conform to the mechanical principles, etc., omitted:</p>

<p> As riding cannot be taught by books, no attempt is made to do so here. Officers instructed in riding at the Mounted Service School are returned to their regiments every year, where, by their example and ability to instruct, they can accomplish far more than any literature on the subject; but where riding, as regards the seat, cannot be readily forgotten, points of training a horse can; and it is for such as forget, or for such as have had nothing or little to forget, that this book is intended.</p>

<p> As to riding, it might be of interest, however, to some to note that the following cautions have been found to be a frequent necessity while training horses with enlisted men up:</p>

<p>Don't yank upon your horse's mouth. Keep your hands low and your wrists supple. Don't stick your knees up in the air. Grip with your knees and the calf of your leg. Let your stirrups out (for most men). Carry your legs back. Don't let your reins flop.</p>

<p>Don't hollow out your back.</p>

<p>Don't let your horse back up (unless the movement is a retrograde one).</p>
Drive him forward. Don't let him bend his neck at the shoulder. Use your leg (or legs). Don't be rough with your horse. New horses sent to a post should be turned over to
one competent officer with assistants, if necessary, for training, li necessary to assign them to troops to assure proper care and grooming, orders should be given that they be exercised only by direction of the officer in charge. Enlisted men specially suited for training horses should be detailed under the above-named officer's direction. Only such enlisted men should be detailed who will not be discharged or detailed on other duty until the training ceases. The training should continue for not less than six months. Horses should, when possible, be assigned trainers who belong to the organization to which the horses are assigned, the rider being assured, if pos;ible, that the horse will be assigned to him after the training is over.</p>

<p>Two officers can train with reasonable satisfaction seventy-five horses, if given one hour and a half per day six days a week, in the riding-hall. As the number ot" horses in the riding-hall at a time gj over fifteen th.2 difficulties increase.
In case it be impossible for new horses tj to be un-der the direction of one officer, organization commanders should keep the horses out of ranks an equal period, and undertake the same training with competent men.
Hard-trotting, uncontrollable horses, uncomfortable to ride and weak in muscular activity, result from lack of training.</p>

<p>From practical work with enlisted men, it has been found that there is little difficulty in teaching them the kinds of aids, with their proper names, and the use and form the various exercises take. The manner in which they apply their aids and perform the exercises varies with the individual's ability to ride and aptitude for training.
When Part II. is undertaken, the difficulties increase. The difficulties do not lie in the use of the double rein, which the men soon become accustomed to, but in understanding. </p>

<p> the flexions and the delicate use of the aids required in these exercises and in the changes of lead at the gallop.
As hands are a most important element in Part II., it is not surprising that men who have ridden perhaps less than three years should have difficulty.</p>

<p>Part II should not be abandoned, either because of the difficulties inherent to the exercises or because of the lack of proper equipment. The use of a double bridle improvised from a watering bridle and a regulation bit is preferable to the use of a single curb immediately succeeding the work with the snaffle alone.</p>
<p> To some it may seem that confusion exists as to ar-rangement of the facts. The scheme of arrangement is as follows: </p>
<p class"indent"> A man, in training a horse, can begin work on the horse with what he finds in the beginning of this book, and as the horse progresses he need only progress in his reading to find new exercises. Certain definitions and explanations are requisite to a proper understanding of an exercise. These are necessarily interpolated.</p>
<p>If the reader will consider the difficulties in setting forth such facts in a logical sequence, he will perhaps be more lenient in his criticisms of this book, although
criticism is expected and sought. </p>

<h2><strong>CHAPTER I.</strong></h2>

<h3>Early Handling.</h3>
<p><em> Object of Training.&mdash;</em> Horse-training is a series of exercises to render the horse obedient and at the same time to preserve and develop his inherent qualities. It is a muscular training which by suppling the parts will strengthen the entire body, and by balancing the horse will develop harmony in his movements.</p>

<p><em>New Horses.&mdash;</em>New horses should be exercised daily, at first being led by men on foot, and later by men mounted on quiet horses. The exercise should be at a walk, and is used to quiet and strengthen the animals. When leading a young horse mounted, the side upon which he is led should often be changed to avoid giving a false set to the neck.</p>

<p><em>Care of New Horses.&mdash;</em>The young horse should have flannel bandages on his forelegs when exercised, from the fetlock to the knee, to support the flexor tendons and to keep the horse from hitting himself, thereby often causing splints.</p>

<p>After exercising, the legs should be rubbed and the tendons massaged, then washed with cool water and flan-nel bandages applied. The tendons are thereby support-ed and wind-puffs and swellings prevented.</p>

<p><em>How to Adjust a Bandage.&mdash;</em>A bandage should be wound up with the tapes inside. Unroll six or eight inch-es of it, and lay this loose portion obliquely across the outside of the leg, close to the knee, with the end reach-ing to about the center of that joint, and the rolled-up part turned to the outside, and directed downward an 1 forward. The bandaging should be continued aroun 1 the fetlock and upper part of the pastern, and brought back close up below the knee. The loose end is then turned down, and the folds of the bandage carried ove:* it. The tapes are tied a little above the center of the cannon bone. (<em>Hayes.</em>)</p>

<p><em>To Approach an Uncertain Horse.&mdash;</em>To go up to an uncertain horse which is held or tied up in the open, approach the foreleg on the near side at an angle of about 70 degrees to the direction of the axis of the horse. Having reached his shoulder, place a hand on his crest and stroke the mane. When a certain de-gree of confidence is restored to the horse, further handling may be undertaken. </p>

<p><em>To Lead a Horse with the Snaffle, and to Adjust Snaffle.&mdash;</em>To lead a horse with a snaffle mounted or dismounted, pass both reins through the near snaffle ring if the horse is to be on the off side. In placng the snaffle bridle upon a fractious horse, place the reins first over the neck, if possible- If the horse objects to having the head-stall put on, unfasten the left cheek-strap from the ring of the snaffle. Place the head-stall in position, then put the bit in the mouth and refasten the cheek-strap. If impracticable to remove the halter before bridling the horse, place the bridle on over the halter, then unfasten the halter, slip the nose-band down over the nostrils, then irrto the mouth and around under the bit and out of the mouth. The halter will then fall off.</p>

<p><em>Longeing.&mdash;</em>The following principles must be considered when longeing:

<ol>

<li>The horse must be controlled by the longe; the only function of the whip is to move the horse forward.</li>
<li>The length of the longe should be frequently changed. The horse should alternately stretch himself on a large circle and bend himself on a small circle.</li>
<li> The gaits should frequently be changed. (<em>Notes d 'Equitation.</em>)

</ol>

<p><em>Method of Longeing a Horse. &mdash; </em> Start the longeing exercise without the longeing whip. Place the cavesson on the horse, if possible, after the halter has been removed, or, if a bridle is on the horse, over the bridle. Fasten the longe into the ring of the cavesson. Face the same way the horse faces and walk near his head, leading him by a short longe in a circle to the left ; right hand on the longe near the horse's head, longe in the left hand, not coiled, but arranged so that in running out quickly it will not become entangled or pinch the fingers.</p>

<p> If the horse refuses to lead, an assistant may urge him forward as quietly as possible from the rear. As the horse becomes accustomed to being led, gradually lengthen the longe and drop back slightly from the head of the horse, toward his shoulders. Cluck to the horse to urge him forward. Use the hand to make motions for the same purpose or tap him lightly with the han I on his side, in case the horse refuses to go forward. If the horse turns toward the trainer, shake the longe so that it lightly taps the nose on the side of the horse which should be toward the center of the circle. Grad-ually, as the horse learns what is wanted, the trainer moves so that the horse circles about him, first at a slow gait, then at the trot, and finally when more proficient, at the canter and gallop.</p>

<p>To slow down the gait, use the voice soothingly and shake the longe up and down gently. To stop the horse, a series of motions of the longe up and down, with a strong pull on the longe as it comes down, will have the greatest effect. The word "whoa" should frequently be used in this movement. When the horse obeys, he should be caressed.</p>

<p>When a horse will go to the left on the longe, even at the walk, he should be practiced going to the right until equally capable on that hand. A horse should not be longed until fatigued.</p>

<p><em>Use of the Longe.&mdash;</em>

<ol>

<li> To exercise young horses without injury. </li>
<li>To give first lessons to horses difficult to manage.</li>
<li> For horses that hold back or fight. </li>
<li> For horses with one shoulder more developed
   than the other.</li>
<li>For horses that will not work equally well on either hand.</li>
<li> For horses that bend themselves with difficulty.</li>
<li>For the first lessons in jumping. (<em>Notes d' Equi-tation.</em>)</li>

</ol>

  <p><em>The Snaffle Bit.&mdash;</em>As early as possible, a bridle and snaffle bit should be put on the horse.</p>

<p>The snaffle is a very mild bit because it acts mostly on the lips and only a little on the bars. The faults of the hand are therefore less prejudicial to the tender mouth of the new horse. When, in the course of training, the horse becomes familiar with the snaffle bit, he may be prepared for the double bridle by the use of t'Ve double snaffle, a bit which is known not to be dangerous and which gives the rider more action upon the horse. The double snaffle should properly be composed of a snaffle without branches and a "Boucher" snaffle. The double snaffle also is useful in the ca&gt;e of a horse that leans on the hands ; the remedy consisting, in this case, of producing action either by alternate effects which make each snaffle bit felt separately, or by cross-effects obtained by the action of one snaffh bit on one side and the other snaffle bit on the other side.</p>



<p><em>Saddling New Horses.&mdash;</em>New horses should be made accustomed to equipment while they are first exercised by leading or when on the longe; first by the blanket and surcingle, then by the saddle being placed on their back. The saddle is put on first without stirrups, then with stir-rups crossed, and then with the stirrups hanging. The girth should at first be tightened slightly, and afterwards readjusted, if necessary, during the exercises. A nervous horse should be longed a little before placing trn saddle on his back.</p>

<p>Horses should not be mounted for the first time on the same day he is first saddled.</p>

<p><em>Mounting the New Horse.&mdash;</em>When first mounting, the rider should get into the saddle as handily and quickly as possible, without being particular as to exactness. An assistant stands facing the horse. The rider slaps the saddle, lets the stirrups drop against the sides of the horse, and then takes up the reins, leaving them very long. In case the horse backs up or tries to move away, the assistant leads him gently up to where he was before and the rider tries to mount again. </p>

<p>If the rider believes that the horse will make violent resistances, he can insure his seat by having a rolled blanket strapped to the pommel of the saddle, to keep his knees in place. With a horse very difficult to mount, where there is danger of severe resistance, the horse should be snubbed up to a strong, quiet horse. Snubbing is only resorted to in cases where longeing and quiet handling have failed to bring about the desired results. </p>

<p>With very restless animals, the assistants stand squarely in front of the horses and simply caress the animals' heads without holding the reins. If a horse is very restless-, and the cavesson has to be used, it should be in the hands of an experienced man. </p>

<p>The following is a position often taken for mounting a restless animal: Take the reins of the snaffle in the left hand, and with the same hand catch hold of the mane at about the middle of the neck so that there is a slight tension on the reins. Take hold of the pommel of the saddle with the right hand and mount, taking care that the left toe does not touch the horse when mount-ing. Above all things, avoid bustling the horse when starting; for. if he is led to expect this, he will never stand quietly to be mounted. Sometimes feeding a horse oats from a pan while he is being mounted causes him to stand quietly.</p>

<p><em>First Lessons after Mounting.&mdash;</em>Never require anything from the horse mounted for the first time. If he walks straight ahead, it is sufficient. Keep the reins separated and feel lightly the snaffle. Ride the horse a few times around the hall to the right and to the left, leaving him as free as possible, if, of course, he is quiet.</p>


<p>If the horse does well, dismount and feed him carrots, if they can be supplied, or a handful of oats. Carrots ought always be cut lengthwise and never across; in the latter case they might stick in the animal's throat.</p>


<p><em>Resistances.&mdash;</em>Among the most violent resistances are bucking and rearing.</p>
<p> If the horse attempts to buck, press him forward with the legs and hold his head high. The rider is more easily displaced if the horse bucks in place. If the rider is not able to make the horse go forward, he should turn him to the right or left with the snaffle bit. As all

horses have a soft and hard side to their mouths, when resistance is encountered in turning to the right, the attempt should be made to turn him to the left. </p>


<p> When a horse rears, separate the reins, and take hold of the mane in the left hand at about the middle of the neck. Lean forward, and when the horse comes down again, push the body back into its place by quickly straightening the arm.</p>
