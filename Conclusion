<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Although all horses are different one from another,
the preceding rules generally apply. The rider who appreciates the needs of his horse is the one most likely to
succeed in training.</p>

<p>To many, the expenditure of six months in training
troop horses by these methods seems unnecessary and
impracticable. With experienced men and amenable
boises the time may be slightly reduced. A horse cannot be hurried, and slipshod, careless training is often
worse than none.</p>

<p>As it has been found entirely practical to follow out
this course with enlisted men on remounts at a regimental post, it is to be hoped that heavy, hard-gaited, uncomfortable horses to ride will soon disappear from the
ranks.</p>
