<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Although all horses are different one from another,
the preceding rules generally apply. The rider who ap-
preciates the needs of his horse is the one most likely to
succeed in training.</p>

<p>To many, the expenditure of six months in training
troop horses by these methods seems unnecessary and
impracticable. With experienced men and amenable
boises the time may be slightly reduced. A horse can-
not be hurried, and slipshod, careless training is often
worse than none.</p>

<p>As it has been found entirely practical to follow out
this course with enlisted men on remounts at a regi-
mental post, it is to be hoped that heavy, hard-gaited, un-
comfortable horses to ride will soon disappear from the
ranks.</p>
