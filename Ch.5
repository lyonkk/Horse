  <center>Changes ok Direction.</center>

  <p>The horse being able to move forward and to de-
  crease and increase gaits with reasonable accuracy,
  changes of direction may be undertaken.</p>

  <p><em>First Bxetcise.</em> &mdash; The horse being at the walk, force
  the horse forward with both legs, use the open rein, and
  i{ he moves off at an angle oblique to the original di-
  rection, although the divergence may be small, it is
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p><em>Second Exercise.</em> &mdash; The horse being at the walk, use
  the right or left leg to help carry the haunches around
  to the left or right; use the right or left rein of opposi-
  tion to turn the horse to the right or left in a direction
  perpendicular to the original. The rein of opposition is
  used to combat the haunches with the shoulder. The
  horse cot yet knowing the meaning of the preponderant
  u&gt;e of one leg of the rider, the shoulder combating the
  haunch will make the haunch swing around, and if the
  horse, every time he is obliged to swing his haunches
  by the rein of opposition, feels the rider's leg on that
  side, he will begin to associate the use of the leg with the
  swinging of the haunches.</p>

  <p><em>Third Exercise.</em> &mdash; As the horse begins to under-
  stand the meaning of the use of one leg, gradually lessen
  the use of the rein of opposition as an open rein, until
  it finally becomes a direct rein, used only to turn the head
  slightly in the new direction. As the rein of opposition,
  or open rein, is diminished, supposing it to have been the
  right rein, gradually bring into play the left rein of sup-
  port to force the fore quarters to the right in the new
  direction. As to the legs: Have both ready to main-
  tain the impulsion, and each ready to act singly in case
  the hind feet do not follow in the track of the fore feet
  in making the change of direction. The hind legs being
  the propellers, and the maximum of power being always
  desirable, for purely mechanical reasons the greatest
  power of the hind legs is obtained when they follow in
  the same path as the forelegs, during turns.</p>

<hr/>


  <p>{<em>Note.</em> &mdash; The third exercise should not be undertaken
  until the horse has accomplished most of the exercises
  of Lateral Equitation, explained in following chapters.)</p>

<p>  Abouts, circles, figures of eight, and serpentines are
  exercises, named in order of difficulty, which may be un-
  dertaken to accomplish the same result as the above
  exercises, with greater exactness. All these exercises
  should be practiced at the walk until proficient before
  attempting them at the slow trot. The rider sits the
  blow trot.</p>

  <p><em>The About on the Forehand at a Halt.</em> &mdash; With
  horses that are naturally impulsive and are continually
  endeavoring to forge to the front, abouts on the forehand
  from the halt may be practiced at this stage of the train-
  ing. With horses of exaggerated impulsiveness it may
  sometimes be undertaken earlier. The exercise should
  come later for less impulsive horses. The movement
  should always be completed by moving the horse straight
  to the front. The about on the forehand should always
  be about the inside leg as a pivot, for otherwise the move-
  ment is a retrograde one and. tends to put the horse be-
  hind the bit.</p>


<hr/>

  <p>It must be understood that at this stage of training,
  that is, during lateral equitation (explained on page 50),
  the about on the forehand is not a finished movement.
  The aids to be used are: To execute an about on the
  forehand to the right ; both legs to arouse impulsion ; the
  right leg to swing the haunches ; the right rein of oppo-
  sition to assist the right leg; the left rein to assist the
  right in its second function of preventing the horse from
  moving forward. The left leg is always ready to pre-
  vent the horse from backing.</p>

<p>  <em>About on the Forehand (Dismounted).</em> &mdash; With some
  horses that are particularly difficult to teach the use of
  the leg as an aid, dismounted work may be resored to.
  Short lessons only should be given.</p>

<p>  Working on the left side, seize the reins six or eight
  inches from the bit in the left hand. Stand facing the
  horse and with the riding-whip touch him in rear of the
  girth where the rider's leg would ordinarily come when
  used as an aid. Increase the force of the whip, begin-
  ning with light taps, until the horse swings his haunches
  away from the whip. The left hand prevents the horse
  moving either forward or backward. If at first the
  horse fails to move his haunches, he may be assisted in
  doing so by bringing the head slightty toward the side
  of the trainer. This opposes the head to the haunches
  and assists the action of the whip.</p>
