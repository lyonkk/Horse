<p>Diagonal Equitation.</p>

<p>Exercises with Body Straight.</p>

<p><em>General Rules for Diagonal Equitation:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Perfection is gained when the body of the horse: from the poll back is in a straight line.</li>
  <li>The horse's head is always turned slightly at the poll to enable him to see in the direction he is going.</li>
  <li>The reins set or place the forehand.</li>
  <li>The legs govern the hindhand.</li>
  <li>The green horse is never passaged directly to the right or left. The direction of motion should not be more than 45 degrees from the direction of the axis of the horse.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Work on Two Tracks.</em> &mdash; This movement consists in

displacing the horse parallel to himself in a direction ob lique to that of his axis, the front and hind legs describing four parallel tracks. The exterior members cross over the interior ones.</p>

<p>The following are the aids in order to move a horse on two tracks to the right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Both legs, if sufficient momentum is not already obtained, should send the horse up into the bit to receive the indications of the reins.</li>
  <li>The right direct rein makes the horse look to the side toward which he should march, and by throwing the weight slightly to the right begins the displacement of the center of gravity towards the right.- The left rein of support acts at the same time as the preceding, to in-sure the lateral displacement of the forehand to the right by further displacing the center of gravity.</li>
  <li>The left leg, at this moment, becomes prepond-erant in order to direct the haunches to the right, while the right leg acts if necessary to limit the displacement of the haunches, and to oblige the horse to maintain his gait and to gain ground to the front as well as to the side.</li>
  <li>The seat is displaced towards the right to aid the horse's movement to that side. <em>(De Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The following are exercises on two tracks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks, Haunches In.</em> &mdash; A two-track movement along the track, with the head to the wall, in which the haunches move on an inside track, the horse heing in the position described above for the work on two tracks and being governed by similar aids.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks, Haunches Out.</em> &mdash; Same as above, except the croup is to the wall and the fore quarters move on an inside track, the hind quarters on the track.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks on the Diagonal.</em> &mdash; A movement in which a horse moves across the hall on the diagonal on two tracks.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks on a Circle.</em> &mdash; Described by its name. The haunches being on a smaller or larger circle than the fore quarters. The same principles apply in each case as described for work on two tracks.</li>
</ol>

<p><Center>Commands.</Center></p>
<p><em>For First Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches in.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Second Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches out.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Third Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Right oblique.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Fourth Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches in (or out).</li>
  <li>March. <em>(Footnote to Saummur Notes.)</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>About on the Forehand at a Halt.</em> &mdash; To execute this movement from left to right the aids are as folows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Carry the weight of the mass over the shoulders by the equal action of both legs.</li>
  <li>Just the horse is about to move out, close the fingers on the reins and prevent further advance.</li>
  <li>Use the right rein of support to bring the weight upon the left shoulder.</li>
  <li>Use the left direct rein to turn the horse's head to the left at the poll.</li>
  <li>Use the left leg to move the haunches to the right.</li>
  <li>The right leg remains ready to maintain the advanced position of the center of gravity and likewise to limit the movement of the haunches to that side.</li>
  <li>The seat should be carried to the right to facil-itate the displacement of the haunches to that side.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>About on the Haunches.</em> &mdash; This movement is more difficult than the about on the forehand and should be undertaken only after the work on two tracks is well understood.</p>

<p>The movement is first taught by moving the horse on two tracks on a small circle; for example, to the right, with haunches in.</p>

<p>Gradually decrease the diameter of the circle as the horse becomes proficient. As the circle becomes smaller change the direction of the rein so that the direction of the pull is toward the right haunche to weight the latter d wn. Likewise increase the pressure of the left leg un-til it is sufficient to prevent little by little any movement on the part of the haunches. The circle then is finally diminished so that the movement is that of a circle on the part of the forehand about the right hind leg as a
pivot. If the movement should be about the left hind leg, or outside leg, as a pivot, it becomes a retrograde movement, which is liable to put the horse behind the bit.</p>

<p><em>The Gallop.</em> &mdash; Heretofore the gallop has been undertaken merely as a means cf exercise tj strengthen and stretch out the hone and to teach him a little in balanc-ing himself by the use of his legs. No attention was paid at first to the leads; later a little lateral equitation was used to partially insure the correct lead.</p>

<p>A horse is leading correctly when the right laterals (right front and right hind) are in advance of the left laterals, when turning to the right. This is called "lead-ing right." A horse is galloping disunited when he is galloping one way in front and another way in rear.</p>

<p>On small circles or sudden turns of direction a horse is liable to fall if not leading correctly.</p>

<p><em>The Right Lead.</em> &mdash; To require a horse to lead to the right, the aids are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Weight of the body to the left, weight in left stirrup in order to weight down the left haunch.</li>
  <li>Use of the left leg to cause the haunches to be displaced to the right, consequently requiring the right lateral to pass the left.
  <li>Use of the right leg to join its action to that of the left to give the necessary impulsion and to receive the haunches and prevent their being moved too far to the right. The horse being driven by the legs up into the bit, is received by the reins in the following manner:</li>
  <li>Right rein of support exerted in a direction to-ward the left shoulder to weight the latter, for it must be slowed down ; at the same time this movement frees the right shoulder and allows it to extend itself. The horse is made to slightly turn the head to the right at the poll in order that he may see in the direction in which he is going.</li>
  <li>Left direct rein corroborates the action of the right and keeps the neck straight. </em>(De Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>
  <li>If the gallop is taken from the trot while post-ing, rising with the right diagonal assists the right lead. Rising from the left diagonal assists the left lead.
  When perfection is attained, the horse does not perceptibly swing his haunches to the right or left.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p><small><em>*Note.</em> &mdash; For paragraphs 4 and 5 the following paragraphs, showing a method of using the reins, may he substituted. This method is taught by some of the best authorities in our service. It certainly can be reasoned out as well as that mentioned above, it is more easy to put in practice and produces results in a scientific manner.</small></p>
<small>
<ol>
  <li>Use the left direct rein to weight the left Shoulder.</li>
  <li>Exert sufficient pressure on the right rein to keep the head from being turned to the left, so that the horse may see where he is going, and at the same time raise the right hand slightly to assist in lightening the weight on the right shoulder, thereby assisting to free it.</li>
