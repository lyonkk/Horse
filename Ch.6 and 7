<center>Outdoor Work.</center>

<p>From the moment the horse will go straight ahead
outdoor work is in some cases a necessity and in all cases
to a greater or less extent desirable. </p>

<p>Horses which tend to get behind the bit or which do
not let themselves out should frequently have outside
work alternated with hall work. The horse being grad-
ually educated to a good free trot should be given them
outdoors, allowing time enough between trots for the
horse to assume normal breathing. Outdoor work should
take place with normal horses two days a week.</p>

<p>All horses need fresh outdoor air occasionally.</p>

<p>Horses that are inclined to bolt or forge ahead con-
tinually, or those that throw most of the weight on the
forehand, need much more hall work than outdoor work.</p>

<p>Young horses especially should be given trots on
soft ground. No horse should be galloped on hard roads.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Soft ground means turf or dirt roads, not plowed land
or stone-built roads. The gallop is undertaken outdoors
only when the horse can be made to lead from either foot.</p>

<p>By going in pairs nervous horses do not fret while
outdoors, as much as though alone. It is likewise bet-
ter not to maintain a formation in ranks while outdoors,
any more than necessary, in order to prevent the new
horses from acquiring the habit of going in ranks and
refusing to leave.</p>

<p>During the last part of outdoor exercise the horse
should be walked so that he is returned to the stable
breathing normally.</p>

<center> Suppling Exercises with Body Bent.</center>

<p><em>Different Kinds of Equitation.</em> &mdash; When, for example,
the right rein and right leg are used to assist each other
in moving the haunches, it is called lateral equitation.
When the reins place the forehand and the legs alone
control the hindhand, as, for example, if the left rein and
right leg are used, it is called diagonal equitation.</p>

<center>Lateral Equitation.</center>

<p>The following points should he considered during
the exercises in lateral equitation :
<ol>
<li> One step taken correctly is at first all that should
be expected or required.</li>

<li> As the movements are fatiguing, they should at
no time be continued more than a few seconds.</li>

<li> Horses that are stiff on one particular side
should be suppled by exercises to that side.</li>


<li> The preceding rule applies to all parts of the
horse except the neck. If the neck is stiff on the right
side, supple it by exercises, as ''Shoulder In" (see below).
on the left hand. <em>(Capt. Short.)</em></li>

<li> The movements are all begun at a walk and
when proficient in them, are executed at a slow trot.</li>

<li> When the movements are executed on a circle,
where the fore quarters are on one circumference and the
hind quarters either on a larger or a smaller circumfer-
ence, the effect, besides being one of suppling, is as fol-
lows: When the haunches are on a smaller circumfer-
ence the horse tends toward collection, his hind quarters
tend to come up under the body, and it is a good move-
ment for a horse that forges ahead ; when the hind quart-
ers are on a circle of greater circumference than the fore
quarters the horse tends to be forced up into the bit and
to stretch out behind, hence it is a useful movement with
sluggish horses or horses that tend to get behind the bit.</li>

<li> When executing any of the following exercises,
if the horse fails to respond to the action of both legs
and does not go up into the bit, cease the exercise at once
and move straight ahead at a trot or gallop and do not
return to the exercise until the horse is again into the bit.</li>

</ol>

<p><em>First Exercise in Suppling the Haunches.</em> &mdash; This les-
son consists in abouts on the forehand while marching.
For example, marching on the right hand, leave the track
on a diagonal (oblique) and return to it by a half turn to
the left exacted by a very pronounced action of the left
leg and left rein. This strongly marked lateral effect
carries the horse's haunches to the right ; that is to say.
the horse while still gaining ground yields to the effect
of the leg (and left rein), and thus describes a half turn.
The same movement is executed while marching on the
left hand and the horse eventually swings the haunches
easily about the forehand, without halting, without strik-
ing the fetlocks, and without dancing. (<em>Notes d'Equi-
tation.</em>)</p>

<p>The commands for this exercise are:</p>
<ol>
<li> Right oblique.</li>

<li> <em>March.</em></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> On forehand.</li>

<li> Half turn in reverse.</li>

<li> <em>March</em>.</li>


</ol>
<hr/>


<p>"Half turn" and "reverse" could, in this case, be
expressed "left half turn," but "in reverse" has partic-
ular significance, and the terms should be retained on that
account.</p>

<p><em>Haunches In.</em> &mdash; This movement is one to exact obe-
dience to one leg while marching. It continues the sup-
pling of the hind quarters and confirms the obedience
to the leg. It should be undertaken only when the horse
yields readily to the legs in previous exercises.</p>

<p>Marching on the right hand, use the left rein of op-
position and the left leg. It is sufficient if the horse
swings his haunches to the right so that the left hind foot
steps on a line passing through the prints of the right fore
foot. The left rein of opposition assists the action of
the left leg. At first one step is sufficient to demand at
a time. Repeat the movement several times, gradually
demanding more steps in the correct position. Never de-
mand the movement, at any one time, over a greater dis-
tance than the long side of the riding hall. The follow-
ing cautions should be carefully observed:</p>



<hr/>
<ol>
<li> Never let the horse's body make an angle of
more than 45 degrees with the original direction. To
prevent this, use the inside leg.</li>

<li> Never let the gait diminish. To prevent this,
use both legs when necessary to demand impulsion.</li>

<li> Do not lean to the left when moving to the right.
The weight of the body should be slightly more upon the
right buttock when moving to the right.</li>

<li> Do not let the right rein be slack when moving
to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Shoulder In.</em> &mdash; This is a similar exercise to haunches
in, but more difficult and more useful.</p>

<p>This movement supples both forehand and hindhand.</p>

<p>To execute the movement when marching on the
right hand:</p>

<p>First use the right open rein and the left rein of
support, the fore quarters are then moved off the track
and the head turned to the right ; the right leg is then used
to push the mass from right to left and the left leg to
receive the swinging of the haunches and to control the
impulsion.</p>


<hr/>

<p><em>Cautions to Be Observed:</em></p>
<ol>
<li> During the first lessons, after the fore quarters
have been moved off the track, to facilitate the movement
along the track, the outside rein may be slightly opened.</li>

<li> The reins prevent the lateral flexion of the neck
at the shoulders by holding the head firmly between them.</li>

<li> The fore quarters are sufficiently removed from
the track if the left fore foot and right hind travel along
the same path parallel to the track.</li>
</ol>
