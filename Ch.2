<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>Equilibrium.</h3>

<p>A little must be understood about equilibrium before
the aids can properly be mastered.</p>

<p><em>Direct Equilibrium.</em> &mdash; This relates to the balance of
the horse when the center of gravity is moved forward
or backward. The fore legs of the horse are used for
translation, (the Hind legs for propulsion. The horse
naturally bears more weight upon his fore legs than upon
his hind. The center of gravity, then, is nearer the fore
quarters than the hind, which is therefore favorable to
the forward movement of the horse.</p>

<p>If the weight of the horse, by changing the position
of parts of the body, brings the center of gravity to-
wards the rear, it is more favorable for the backward
movement.</p>

<p>When the center of gravity is forward, the forelegs
control the movement of the mass, and the hind legs
merely propel. When the center of gravity moves back-
ward, the hind legs become more and more masters of
the control of the movement of the mass, and their ac-
tion then is from the ground up as well as from rear to
front as before. In other words, the movements gain
in height.</p>

<p><em>Position of a Horse for the Forzvard Movement. &mdash;</p></em>
<ol>
  <li> When a horse wants to move forward, he natur-
    ally puts himself in the most favorable position; conse-
    quently he throws his weight forward to his shoulders,
    and, to do this, stretches out his head and neck.</li>

  <li> To obtain the forward movement and the ac-
    celerations in gait then, the rider must let the horse ex-
    tend and lower his head and neck; similarly he must
    raise them to obtain the slower gaits.</li>

  <li> <em>A horse must always be ready to carry himself
    forward.</em> This is the most important rule in equitation.
    The tendency to move forward is called "impulsion."
    Without impulsion we can have no influence over the
    direction. (<em>.De Saint-Phalle.</em>)</li>
</ol>



<hr/>

<p>The horse must go into the bridle. Nearly every
vice and resistance offered by a horse is preceded and
made possible by the animal getting behind the bit; that
is, he refuses to lace the bit, or take the pressure of the
bit, so that the rider's hand can find nothing by which
he can enforce his demands. (<em>Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Lateral 'Equilibrium.</em> &mdash; This relates to the balance of
a horse when the center of gravity is moved sideways.
It is a case where the horse is made to load one shoulder
or one haunch or all one side more than the other. It
is used for changes of direction, parallel displacements,
etc. The horse being in motion, if we force him to car-
ry the weight of his forehand to one side, the entire fore
hand tends to be displaced to the same side. This dis-
placement of the horse is obligatory if that of the center
of gravity is sufficiently accentuated.</p>

<center>The Aids.</center>
<p><em>What Are the Aids?</em> &mdash; The aids are the different
means employed by the rider to convey his desires or
intentions to the horse. (Notes d' Equitation.)</p>


<hr/>

<center>The Legs.</center>

<p><em>The Stirrups.</em> &mdash; The stirrups should be so adjusted
that the tread of the stirrup is level with the top of the
heel when the rider is mounted and seated properly.
When the stirrups are too long, as with the "fork seat,"
the rider is unable to use his legs with strength and ac-
curacy. With the stirrups too short the rider's knees are
too high, the seat is forced too far back and he is unabl i
to sit down in the saddle; hence is less secure.</p>

<p><em>Position of the Foot in the Stirrup.</em> &mdash; At least one-
third of the foot should be inserted in the stirrup; the
1 eel should be slightly lower than the toe and the ball
of the foot should rest upon the tread. (Notes d' Equi-
tation.)</p>

<p>The following are the uses to which the legs
are put.</p>
<ol>

<p><li> To produce the forward movement.</p></li>

<p><li> To range the haunches.</p></li>

<p><li> To bring the hind legs forward under the body.</li>
  </ul>

<p><em>The Equal Action of Both Legs.</em> &mdash; The most import-
ant duty of the legs is to act together for the purpose of
giving or sustaining impulsion. This action should com-
mand the forward movement and its acceleration. To
obtain this result, the legs can act by simple pressure of
the knees or by pressure of the knees and calves. The
pressure of only the knees is sufficient with delicate
horses, but with others the pressure of the calves has to
be added to that of the knees. The more energetic the
pressure and the farther behind the girths it is, the great-
er the result produced. Usually the action of the leg is
strong enough if it is placed against or a little in rear
of the girth. Tf the action ther i is not sufficient, it
may be carried back a little â€” never, however, to reach
an angle of 45 degrees. The perfection to aim at is to
have the leg move almost imperceptibly and vary its ef-
fects only by different shades of p ensure; but with a
horse that do?s not respond sufficiently to the demands,
it becomes necessary to carry the leg back a little by
bending the knee and keeping the heels low. The in-
clination of the leg to an angle of 45 degrees is the very
maximum, which it is unscientific and useless to pass or
even to reach, so that i*" th Q action of the leg is not efficacious under these conditions, we must turn to more
energetic methods. But little trouble is experienced in
teaching riders not to carry the legs too far back. The
reverse is usually the case.</p>

<p>The above method failing, the next to try is consec-
utive thumpings with the calf of the leg, not very pro-
nounced, but repeated until the result sought is obtained.
At the instant the legs should cease their action, and
should repeat it only when the need again is felt.</p>

<p>If this means is not sufficient, there is nothing to do
but come to blows with the legs. These are executed
by slightly carrying to one side the calf and ramming
it against the horse with a violence proportionate to the
result to be obtained. This movement ought to be done
without raising the knees or sticking them out, the lower
part of the legs being independent of the rest of the body
in order that the seat and the hand be not deranged.
This manner of getting action upon the horse ought not
to be continued for a long time, even if its effect is not
sufficient or lasting. Like every violent movement, this
one ought to be exceptional, and rather than repeat it
frequently, it is better to have recourse to short, ener-
getic action of the spurs.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to avoid the frequent fault of
using the leg after sufficient action has been gotten out
of the horse or of continuing the demands when they are
already obeyed. Then the impulsion of the horse is aug-
mented in a manner prejudicial to the desired result,
which necessitates the action of the hand to oppose the
augmented impulsion falsely ordered by the legs.</p>

<p><em>Unequal Action of the Leas.</em> &mdash; When one leg is used
more than the other, the haunches are displaced to the
opposite side. The horse is then said "to range his
haunches." This effect is often useful in preventing the
horse from slipping out sideways, in straightening him,
and in making him change directions, etc. ; but its great-
est utility lies in permitting the rider to range the haunch-
es and traverse the horse, which movements are essential
to the main instruction in the mental and physical sup-
pling of the horse.</p>

<p>The rules for the use of both legs apply equally well
to the use of one leg, as regards place of contact and
manner of graduating the intensity of action. ("Equal
Action of Both Legs and Unequal Action of the Leg,"
from "Elementary Equitation," by De Saint-Phalle.)</p>

<p><em>To Bring the Hind Legs Forward Under the
Horse.</em> &mdash; Due to contraction of the muscles produced by
the tickling sensation of the le^ or spur upon the side,
the horse mechanically brings his hind legs up under the
body when so forced. This bringing up of the hind legs
places the control of the movement of the mass in their
power, because the center of gravity is nearer their base.
Hence the leg movements become more elevated, the
speed less fast, and the horse more handy and more eas-
ily controlled.</p>

<p>Mutual Support by the Legs. &mdash; If one leg acts to
range the haunches, the other should receive the mass to
limit and control the movement. Both legs should be at
all times close enough to the horse to act accurately,
quickly, and without abruptness in order to assist each
other.</p>

<p><em>When a Horse Is "Behind the Legs." </em> &mdash; When a horse
refuses to move forward after the equal action of both
legs is produced, he is said to be "behind the bit" and like
wise "behind the legs." A horse in this state is beyond
the control of the rider, and every means should be ex-
erted to force the horse with the legs up into the bit
again.</p>

<p><em>The Spur.</em> &mdash; The spur should not be used until the
seat is secure. If the pressure of the calves of the legs
is sufficient to command impulsion, the spur should not
be resorted to.</p>

<p>Resistances are provoked if the spur remains in the
side continuously, and the animal becomes disobedient
and on the defensive. Continued contact should be re-
placed by repeated contacts of short duration of an inten-
sity to fit the case.</p>

<p>The length of the spur varies with the length of the
stirrup leathers, the length of the leg of the rider, and
the form of the horse. A general rule is that the spur
should be of such a length as to be easily used with-
out danger of unintentional usage during sudden dis-
placements.</p>


<hr/>

<center> The Reins.</center>

<p>In the training of the horse the reins should be held
in two hands. Single reins should be held as prescribed
in the Cavalry Drill Regulations.</p>

<p>The following important rule should always be ob-
served : The pressure of the rider's legs, or of his heels,
must always precede any action of the hand; in other
words, the bit does not go back to the horse, but the horse
goes forward against the bit.</p>

<p>It has been shown that by the action of the legs im-
pulsion is produced in the horse, which causes a stretch-
ing of the neck to the front in order to begin or accel-
erate the forward movement. If as the head and neck
stretch out the forward movement of the bit in the mouth
is arrested by the hand, the bit is brought into stronger
contact with the bars of the mouth, which produces its
action. The action of the reins is thus produced after
the action of the legs has produced its effect.</p>

<center>Kinds of Reins. (De Saint-Phalle.)</center>
<p><em>Open Rein.</em> &mdash; This rein is used in turning the horse.
The right rein, for example, is said to be open if the
right hand is carried to the right and front. Reins are
so used for the particular effect they have upo:i the
horse's head. The need of them is felt especially in the
training of green horses, but also with a horse that re-
fuses to turn and carries his head in the opposite direc-
tion from that in which the rider desires him to go.
When the right rein is open, the horse's head will be
drawn to the right and he will be assisted in moving in
that direction.</p>

<p><em>Direct Rein.</em> &mdash; This rein acts parallel to the axis of
the horse without intermediary action upon the neck.
Reins used in this manner bring a little of the weight to
the side on which they act, which with an obedient horse
suffices to make him turn to that side. It is also used
in turning the horse's head at the poll so that the horse
may look in the direction toward which he is going.</p>

<p><em>Rein of Support.</em> &mdash; The right rein, for example, is
called the right rein of support when the right hand
moves from right to left and the right rein hence bears
against the neck. It has different effects according to
the point towards which its action is directed. For example,
if the hand is moved towards the front of or over
the left shoulder, the effect is to bring the weight of the
forehand towards that shoulder; or if the direction of
the right rein of support passes in rear of the withers,
the effect is felt by the increased weight on the left
haunch; or if the action of the rein in this direction is
sufficiently strong, it can either lead to the displacement
of the haunches towards the left by setting the left
shoulder, or displace simultaneously the shoulders and
the haunches towards the left by pushing the horse en-
tirely to that side.</p>

<p>The effect of the rein of support is extremely power-
ful in preventing the horse from slipping out on its side,
or in restraining the horse from turning in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p><em>Rein of Opposition.</em> &mdash; If the rider opens the right
rein slightly and pulls either in the direction of the right
haunch or the direction of the left haunch, the rein is
called the right rein of opposition. He is then said to
set the shoulders in opposition to the haunches. (Notes
d' Equitation.)</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>General Rule:</em>&mdash; A general rule is, that at all times
contact is kept with the mouth by the reins through the
medium of the bit. The reins never flop. There are
two exceptions to this rule allowable: during complete
abandon, as at the walk; and momentarily, during flex-
ions, as will be shown later.</p>

<p></em>The Seat.</em> &mdash; The seat is an aid when it changes the
support of the body from one buttock to the other to
assist the horse in lateral movements. This movement
helps to carry the center of gravity of the horse to the
side toward which the movement is des'red. Similarly
an increase in the weight placed on one stirrup is an aid.
The upper part of the body by leaning forward or
bick likewise assists the horse in moving the center of
gravity forward am! back.</p>
