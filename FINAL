<h1 class"center-ok"> FOREWORD. </h1>

<p>The object of this book is to arrange in the most convenient, clear and concise form the modern system of horse-training, in so. far as it is applicable to the train-ing of horses in the mounted service of the United States-No attempt has been made in any case to improve upon methods already deemed correct by the best horse-men ; and as such methods can be found dealing with all points of training, it follows that the subject matter in this book is not original. Where the best was to be found, there it has been sought, and where the authors of previous works have expressed their ideas in language considered the most concise and clear, their words have been copied verbatim, with due acknowledgement to the authors.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the following for methods, theories, translation of technical terms, and improvised commands herein contained :</p>

<p><strong> PREFACE </strong> </p>
Nothing within this book is believed to be beyond the reach of the mounted service in <strong> general </strong>.
The time allotted to "breaking" or gentling will be in many cases eliminated, as the present system of remount stations has become well established.

<p>Each troop should have three or four such articles as longes and cavessons. These articles can be made very easily by saddlers and blacksmiths, from a model. Models can undoubtedly be procured through the Mount-ed Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, or from any saddlery store, care being taken in purchasing from the latter to determine whether the model is a correct one or not.</p>
<p>In many cases the reasons for the use of certain aids, etc., are apparent, and all explanation is omitted. In other cases, where explanations involve nice points of mechanics, etc., they have likewise been omitted. The reason for the latter omissions bdng, that they are interesting to the student only.</p>

<p> The real student of horse-training can only be one who enjoys such work. Many officers do not enjoy it, and this book is intended for all.
In view of the fact that all the methods embodied herein are well-recognized methods, I trust readers will take for granted that they conform to the mechanical principles, etc., omitted. :</p>

<p> As riding cannot be taught by books, no attempt is made to do so here. Officers instructed in riding at the Mounted Service School are returned to their reg-iments every year, where, by their example and ability to instruct, they can accomplish far more than any liter-ature on the subject; but where riding, as regards the seat, cannot be readily forgotten, points of training a horse can; and it is for such as forget, or for such as have had nothing or little to forget, that this book is intended.</p>

<p> As to riding, it might be of interest, however, to some to note that the following cautions have been found to be a frequent necessity while training horses with en-listed men up:
Preface. Don't yank upon your horse's mouth. Keep your hands low and your wrists supple. Don't stick your knees up in the air. Grip with your knees and the calf of your leg. Let your stirrups out (for most men). Carry your legs back. Don't let your reins flop.

<p>Don't hollow out your back.</p>
<p>Don't let your horse back up (unless the movement is a retrograde one).</p>
Drive him forward. Don't let him bend his neck at the shoulder. Use your leg (or legs). Don't be rough with your horse. New horses sent to a post should be turned over to
one competent officer with assistants, if necessary, for training, li necessary to assign them to troops to assure proper care and grooming, orders should be given that they be exercised only by direction of the officer in charge. Enlisted men specially suited for training horses should be detailed under the above-named officer's di-

rection. Only such enlisted men should be detailed who will not be discharged or detailed on other duty until the training ceases. The training should continue for not less than six months. Horses should, when possible, be assigned trainers who belong to the organization to which the horses are assigned, the rider being assured, if pos;ible, that the horse will be assigned to him after the training is over.
<p>Two officers can train with reasonable satisfaction seventy-five horses, if given one hour and a half per day six days a week, in the riding-hall. As the number ot" horses in the riding-hall at a time gj over fifteen th.2 difficulties increase.
In case it be impossible for new horses tj to be un-der the direction of one officer, organization commanders should keep the horses out of ranks an equal period, and undertake the same training with competent men.
Hard-trotting, uncontrollable horses, uncomfortable t ride and weak in muscular activity, result from lack of training.</p>

<p>From practical work with enlisted men, it has been found that there is little difficulty in teaching them the kinds of aids, with their proper names, and the use and form the various exercises take. The manner in which they apply their aids and perform the exercises varies with the individual's ability to ride and aptitude for training.
When Part II. is undertaken, the difficulties increase. The difficulties do not lie in the use of the double rein, which the men soon become accustomed to, but in understanding. </p>

<p> the flexions and the delicate use of the aids required in these exercises and in the changes of lead at the gallop.
As hands are a most important element in Part II., it is not surprising that men who have ridden perhaps less than three years should have difficulty. Part II should not be abandoned, either because of the difficulties inherent to the exercises or because of the lack of proper equipment. The use of a double bridle improvised from a watering bridle and a regulation bit is preferable to the use of a single curb immediately succeeding the work with the snaffle alone.</p>
<p> To some it may seem that confusion exists as to ar-rangement of the facts. The scheme of arrangement is as follows: </p>
<p class"indent"> A man, in training a horse, can begin work on the horse with what he finds in the beginning of this book, and as the horse progresses he need only progress in his reading to find new exercises. Certain definitions and explanations are requisite to a proper understanding of an exercise. These are necessarily interpolated.</p>
<p>If the reader will consider the difficulties in setting forth such facts in a logical sequence, he will perhaps be more lenient in his criticisms of this book, although
criticism is expected and sought. </p>

<h2><strong>CHAPTER I.</strong></h2>

<h3>Early Handling.</h3>
<p><em> Object of Training.</em> &mdash; Horse-training is a series of exercises to render the horse obedient and at the same time to preserve and develop his inherent qualities. It is a muscular training which by suppling the parts will strengthen the entire body, and by balancing the horse will develop harmony in his movements.</p>

<p><em>New Horses.</em> &mdash; New horses should be exercised daily, at first being led by men on foot, and later by men mounted on quiet horses. The exercise should be at a walk, and is used to quiet and strengthen the animals. When leading a young horse mounted, the side upon which he is led should often be changed to avoid giving a false set to the neck.</p>

<p><em>Care of New Horses.</em> &mdash; The young horse should have
flannel bandages on his forelegs when exercised, from the fetlock to the knee, to support the flexor tendons and to keep the horse from hitting himself, thereby often catching splints.</p>

<p>After exercising, the legs should be rubbed and the tendons massaged, then washed with cool water and flan-nel bandages applied. The tendons are thereby supported and wind&mdash;puffs and swellings prevented.</p>

<p><em>How to Adjust a Bandage.</em> &mdash; A bandage should be wound up with the tapes inside. Unroll six or eight inches of it, and lay this loose portion obliquely across the outside of the leg, close to the knee, with the end reaching to about the center of that joint, and the rolled&mdash;up part turned to the outside, and directed downward and 1 forward. The bandaging should be continued around the fetlock and upper part of the pastern, and brought back close up below the knee. The loose end is then turned down, and the folds of the bandage carried over it. The tapes are tied a little above the center of the cannon bone. (<em>Hayes.</em>)</p>

<p><em>To Approach an Uncertain Horse.</em> &mdash; To go up to an uncertain horse which is held or tied up in the open, approach the foreleg on the near side at an angle of about 70 degrees to the direction of the axis of the horse. Having reached his shoulder, place a hand on his crest and stroke the mane. When a certain de-gree of confidence is restored to the horse, further handling may be undertaken.</p>


<p><em>To Lead a Horse with the Snaffle, and to Adjust Snaffle.</em> &mdash; To lead a horse with a snaffle mounted or dismounted, pass both reins through the near snaffle ring if the horse is to be on the off side. In placng the snaffle bridle upon a fractious horse, place the reins first over the neck, if possible&mdash; If the horse objects to having the head&mdash;stall put on, unfasten the left cheek&mdash;strap from the ring of the snaffle. Place the head&mdash;stall in position, then put the bit in the mouth and refasten the cheek&mdash;strap. If impracticable to remove the halter before bridling the horse, place the bridle on over the halter, then unfasten the halter, slip the nose&mdash;band down over the nostrils, then into the mouth and around under the bit and out of the mouth. The halter will then fall off.</p>

<p><em>Longeing.</em> The following principles must be considered when longeing:</p>

<ol>

<li>The horse must be controlled by the longe; the only function of the whip is to move the horse forward.</li>
<li>The length of the longe should be frequently changed. The horse should alternately stretch himself on a large circle and bend himself on a small circle.</li>
<li> The gaits should frequently be changed. (<em>Notes d'Equitation.</em>)

</ol>

<p><em>Method of Longeing a Horse.</em> &mdash; Start the longeing exercise without the longeing whip. Place the cavesson on the horse, if possible, after the halter has been removed, or, if a bridle is on the horse, over the bridle. Fasten the longe into the ring of the cavesson. Face the same way the horse faces and walk near his head, leading him by a short longe in a circle to the left ; right hand on the longe near the horse's head, longe in the left hand, not coiled, but arranged so that in running out quickly it will not become entangled or pinch the fingers.</p>

<p>If the horse refuses to lead, an assistant may urge him forward as quietly as possible from the rear. As the horse becomes accustomed to being led, gradually lengthen the longe and drop back slightly from the head of the horse, toward his shoulders. Cluck to the horse to urge him forward. Use the hand to make motions for the same purpose or tap him lightly with the han I on his side, in case the horse refuses to go forward. If the horse turns toward the trainer, shake the longe so that it lightly taps the nose on the side of the horse which should be toward the center of the circle. Gradually, as the horse learns what is wanted, the trainer moves so that the horse circles about him, first at a slow gait, then at the trot, and finally when more proficient, at the canter and gallop.</p>

<p>To slow down the gait, use the voice soothingly and shake the longe up and down gently. To stop the horse, a series of motions of the longe up and down, with a strong pull on the longe as it comes down, will have the greatest effect. The word &quot;whoa&quot; should frequently be used in this movement. When the horse obeys, he should be caressed.</p>

<p>When a horse will go to the left on the longe, even at the walk, he should be practiced going to the right until equally capable on that hand. A horse should not be longed until fatigued.</p>

<p><em>Use of the Longe.</em> &mdash;

<ol>

<li> To exercise young horses without injury. </li>
<li>To give first lessons to horses difficult to manage.</li>
<li> For horses that hold back or fight. </li>
<li> For horses with one shoulder more developed
   than the other.</li>
<li>For horses that will not work equally well on either hand.</li>
<li> For horses that bend themselves with difficulty.</li>
<li>For the first lessons in jumping. (<em>Notes d'Equitation.</em>)</li>

</ol>

  <p><em>The Snaffle Bit.</em> &mdash; As early as possible, a bridle and snaffle bit should be put on the horse.</p>

<p>The snaffle is a very mild bit because it acts mostly on the lips and only a little on the bars. The faults of the hand are therefore less prejudicial to the tender mouth of the new horse. When, in the course of training, the horse becomes familiar with the snaffle bit, he may be prepared for the double bridle by the use of t'Ve double snaffle, a bit which is known not to be dangerous and which gives the rider more action upon the horse. The double snaffle should properly be composed of a snaffle without branches and a &quot;Boucher&quot; snaffle. The double snaffle also is useful in the catch of a horse that leans on the hands; the remedy consisting, in this case, of producing action either by alternate effects which make each snaffle bit felt separately, or by cross-effects obtained by the action of one snaffle bit on one side and the other snaffle bit on the other side.</p>



<p><em>Saddling New Horses.</em> &mdash; New horses should be made accustomed to equipment while they are first exercised by leading or when on the longe; first by the blanket and surcingle, then by the saddle being placed on their back. The saddle is put on first without stirrups, then with stir-rups crossed, and then with the stirrups hanging. The girth should at first be tightened slightly, and afterwards readjusted, if necessary, during the exercises. A nervous horse should be longed a little before placing trn saddle on his back.</p>



<p> Horses should not be mounted for the first time on the same day he is first saddled.</p>

<p><em>Mounting the New Horse.</em> &mdash; When first mounting,

the rider should get into the saddle as handily and quickly as possible, without being particular as to exactness.

An assistant stands facing the horse. The rider slaps the saddle, lets the stirrups drop against the sides of the horse, and then takes up the reins, leaving them very long. In case the horse backs up or tries to move away, the assistant leads him gently up to where he was before and the rider tries to mount again. </p>


<p>If the rider believes that the horse will make violent resistances, he can insure his seat by having a rolled blanket strapped to the pommel of the saddle, to keep his knees in place. With a horse very difficult to mount, where there is danger of severe resistance, the horse should be snubbed up to a strong, quiet horse. Snubbing is only resorted to in cases where longeing and quiet handling have failed to bring about the desired results. </p>

<p>With very restless animals, the assistants stand squarely in front of the horses and simply caress the animals' heads without holding the reins. If a horse is very restless-, and the cavesson has to be used, it should be in the hands of an experienced man. </p>

<p>The following is a position often taken for mount-ing a restless animal: Take the reins of the snaffle in the left hand, and with the same hand catch hold of the mane at about the middle of the neck so that there is a slight tension on the reins. Take hold of the pommel of the saddle with the right hand and mount, taking care that the left toe does not touch the horse when mount-ing. Above all things, avoid bustling the horse when starting; for. if he is led to expect this, he will never stand quietly to be mounted. Sometimes feeding a horse oats from a pan while he is being mounted causes him to stand quietly.</p>

<p><em>First Lessons after Mounting.</em> &mdash; Never require anything from the horse mounted for the first time. If he walks stiaight ahead, it is sufficient. Keep the reins separated and feel lightly the snaffle. Ride the horse a few times around the hall to the right and to the left, leaving him as free as possible, if, of course, he is quiet.</p>


<p>If the horse does well, dismount and feed him carrots, if they can be supplied, or a handful of oats. Carrots ought always be cut lengthwise and never across; in the latter case they might stick in the animal's throat.</p>


<p><em>Resistances.</em> &mdash; Among the most violent resistances are bucking and rearing.</p>
<p> If the horse attempts to buck, press him forward with the legs and hold his head high. The rider is more easily displaced if the horse bucks in place. If the rider is not able to make the horse go forward, he should turn him to the right or left with the snaffle bit. As all horses have a soft and hard side to their mouths, when resistance is encountered in turning to the right, the attempt should be made to turn him to the left. </p>

<p> When a horse rears, separate the reins, and take hold of the mane in the left hand at about the middle of the neck. Lean forward, and when the horse comes down again, push the body back into its place by quickly straightening the arm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>Equilibrium.</h3>

<p>A little must be understood about equilibrium before
the aids can properly be mastered.</p>

<p><em>Direct Equilibrium.</em> &mdash; This relates to the balance of
the horse when the center of gravity is moved forward
or backward. The fore legs of the horse are used for
translation, (the Hind legs for propulsion. The horse
naturally bears more weight upon his fore legs than upon
his hind. The center of gravity, then, is nearer the fore
quarters than the hind, which is therefore favorable to
the forward movement of the horse.</p>

<p>If the weight of the horse, by changing the position
of parts of the body, brings the center of gravity towards the rear, it is more favorable for the backward
movement.</p>

<p>When the center of gravity is forward, the forelegs
control the movement of the mass, and the hind legs
merely propel. When the center of gravity moves back-
ward, the hind legs become more and more masters of
the control of the movement of the mass, and their ac-
tion then is from the ground up as well as from rear to
front as before. In other words, the movements gain
in height.</p>

<p><em>Position of a Horse for the Forward Movement.</p></em> &mdash;
<ol>
  <li> When a horse wants to move forward, he naturally puts himself in the most favorable position; consequently he throws his weight forward to his shoulders,
    and, to do this, stretches out his head and neck.</li>

  <li> To obtain the forward movement and the accelerations in gait then, the rider must let the horse extend and lower his head and neck; similarly he must
    raise them to obtain the slower gaits.</li>

  <li> <em>A horse must always be ready to carry himself
    forward.</em> This is the most important rule in equitation.
    The tendency to move forward is called "impulsion."
    Without impulsion we can have no influence over the
    direction. (<em>De Saint-Phalle.</em>)</li>
</ol>


<p>The horse must go into the bridle. Nearly every
vice and resistance offered by a horse is preceded and
made possible by the animal getting behind the bit; that
is, he refuses to lace the bit, or take the pressure of the
bit, so that the rider's hand can find nothing by which
he can enforce his demands. (<em>Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Lateral Equilibrium.</em> &mdash; This relates to the balance of
a horse when the center of gravity is moved sideways.
It is a case where the horse is made to load one shoulder
or one haunch or all one side more than the other. It
is used for changes of direction, parallel displacements,
etc. The horse being in motion, if we force him to carry the weight of his forehand to one side, the entire fore
hand tends to be displaced to the same side. This displacement of the horse is obligatory if that of the center
of gravity is sufficiently accentuated.</p>

<center>The Aids.</center>
<p><em>What Are the Aids?</em> &mdash; The aids are the different
means employed by the rider to convey his desires or
intentions to the horse. (Notes d'Equitation.)</p>



<center>The Legs.</center>

<p><em>The Stirrups.</em> &mdash; The stirrups should be so adjusted
that the tread of the stirrup is level with the top of the
heel when the rider is mounted and seated properly.
When the stirrups are too long, as with the "fork seat,"
the rider is unable to use his legs with strength and accuracy. With the stirrups too short the rider's knees are
too high, the seat is forced too far back and he is unable
to sit down in the saddle; hence is less secure.</p>

<p><em>Position of the Foot in the Stirrup.</em> &mdash; At least one-
third of the foot should be inserted in the stirrup; the
1st heel should be slightly lower than the toe and the ball
of the foot should rest upon the tread. (Notes d'Equitation.)</p>

<p>The following are the uses to which the legs
are put.</p>
<ol>

<p><li> To produce the forward movement.</p></li>

<p><li> To range the haunches.</p></li>

<p><li> To bring the hind legs forward under the body.</li>
  </ul>

<p><em>The Equal Action of Both Legs.</em> &mdash; The most important duty of the legs is to act together for the purpose of
giving or sustaining impulsion. This action should command the forward movement and its acceleration. To
obtain this result, the legs can act by simple pressure of
the knees or by pressure of the knees and calves. The
pressure of only the knees is sufficient with delicate
horses, but with others the pressure of the calves has to
be added to that of the knees. The more energetic the
pressure and the farther behind the girths it is, the greater the result produced. Usually the action of the leg is
strong enough if it is placed against or a little in rear
of the girth. If the action there is not sufficient, it
may be carried back a little &mdash; never, however, to reach
an angle of 45 degrees. The perfection to aim at is to
have the leg move almost imperceptibly and vary its effects only by different shades of pressure; but with a
horse that does not respond sufficiently to the demands,
it becomes necessary to carry the leg back a little by
bending the knee and keeping the heels low. The inclination of the leg to an angle of 45 degrees is the very
maximum, which it is unscientific and useless to pass or
even to reach, so that if the action of the leg is not efficacious under these conditions, we must turn to more
energetic methods. But little trouble is experienced in
teaching riders not to carry the legs too far back. The
reverse is usually the case.</p>

<p>The above method failing, the next to try is consecutive thumpings with the calf of the leg, not very pronounced, but repeated until the result sought is obtained.
At the instant the legs should cease their action, and
should repeat it only when the need again is felt.</p>

<p>If this means is not sufficient, there is nothing to do
but come to blows with the legs. These are executed
by slightly carrying to one side the calf and ramming
it against the horse with a violence proportionate to the
result to be obtained. This movement ought to be done
without raising the knees or sticking them out, the lower
part of the legs being independent of the rest of the body
in order that the seat and the hand be not deranged.
This manner of getting action upon the horse ought not
to be continued for a long time, even if its effect is not
sufficient or lasting. Like every violent movement, this
one ought to be exceptional, and rather than repeat it
frequently, it is better to have recourse to short, energetic action of the spurs.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to avoid the frequent fault of
using the leg after sufficient action has been gotten out
of the horse or of continuing the demands when they are
already obeyed. Then the impulsion of the horse is augmented in a manner prejudicial to the desired result,
which necessitates the action of the hand to oppose the
augmented impulsion falsely ordered by the legs.</p>

<p><em>Unequal Action of the Legs.</em> &mdash; When one leg is used
more than the other, the haunches are displaced to the
opposite side. The horse is then said "to range his
haunches." This effect is often useful in preventing the
horse from slipping out sideways, in straightening him,
and in making him change directions, etc.; but its greatest utility lies in permitting the rider to range the haunches and traverse the horse, which movements are essential
to the main instruction in the mental and physical suppling of the horse.</p>

<p>The rules for the use of both legs apply equally well
to the use of one leg, as regards place of contact and
manner of graduating the intensity of action. ("Equal
Action of Both Legs and Unequal Action of the Leg,"
from "Elementary Equitation," by De Saint-Phalle.)</p>

<p><em>To Bring the Hind Legs Forward Under the
Horse.</em> &mdash; Due to contraction of the muscles produced by
the tickling sensation of the leg or spur upon the side,
the horse mechanically brings his hind legs up under the
body when so forced. This bringing up of the hind legs
places the control of the movement of the mass in their
power, because the center of gravity is nearer their base.
Hence the leg movements become more elevated, the
speed less fast, and the horse more handy and more easily controlled.</p>

<p>Mutual Support by the Legs. &mdash; If one leg acts to
range the haunches, the other should receive the mass to
limit and control the movement. Both legs should be at
all times close enough to the horse to act accurately,
quickly, and without abruptness in order to assist each
other.</p>

<p><em>When a Horse Is "Behind the Legs." </em> &mdash; When a horse
refuses to move forward after the equal action of both
legs is produced, he is said to be "behind the bit" and like
wise "behind the legs." A horse in this state is beyond
the control of the rider, and every means should be exerted to force the horse with the legs up into the bit
again.</p>

<p><em>The Spur.</em> &mdash; The spur should not be used until the
seat is secure. If the pressure of the calves of the legs
is sufficient to command impulsion, the spur should not
be resorted to.</p>

<p>Resistances are provoked if the spur remains in the
side continuously, and the animal becomes disobedient
and on the defensive. Continued contact should be replaced by repeated contacts of short duration of an intensity to fit the case.</p>

<p>The length of the spur varies with the length of the
stirrup leathers, the length of the leg of the rider, and
the form of the horse. A general rule is that the spur
should be of such a length as to be easily used without danger of unintentional usage during sudden displacements.</p>

<center> The Reins.</center>

<p>In the training of the horse the reins should be held
in two hands. Single reins should be held as prescribed
in the Cavalry Drill Regulations.</p>

<p>The following important rule should always be observed: The pressure of the rider's legs, or of his heels,
must always precede any action of the hand; in other
words, the bit does not go back to the horse, but the horse
goes forward against the bit.</p>

<p>It has been shown that by the action of the legs impulsion is produced in the horse, which causes a stretching of the neck to the front in order to begin or accelerate the forward movement. If as the head and neck
stretch out the forward movement of the bit in the mouth
is arrested by the hand, the bit is brought into stronger
contact with the bars of the mouth, which produces its
action. The action of the reins is thus produced after
the action of the legs has produced its effect.</p>

<center>Kinds of Reins. (De Saint-Phalle.)</center>
<p><em>Open Rein.</em> &mdash; This rein is used in turning the horse.
The right rein, for example, is said to be open if the
right hand is carried to the right and front. Reins are
so used for the particular effect they have upon the
horse's head. The need of them is felt especially in the
training of green horses, but also with a horse that refuses to turn and carries his head in the opposite direction from that in which the rider desires him to go.
When the right rein is open, the horse's head will be
drawn to the right and he will be assisted in moving in
that direction.</p>

<p><em>Direct Rein.</em> &mdash; This rein acts parallel to the axis of
the horse without intermediary action upon the neck.
Reins used in this manner bring a little of the weight to
the side on which they act, which with an obedient horse
suffices to make him turn to that side. It is also used
in turning the horse's head at the poll so that the horse
may look in the direction toward which he is going.</p>

<p><em>Rein of Support.</em> &mdash; The right rein, for example, is
called the right rein of support when the right hand
moves from right to left and the right rein hence bears
against the neck. It has different effects according to
the point towards which its action is directed. For example,
if the hand is moved towards the front of or over
the left shoulder, the effect is to bring the weight of the
forehand towards that shoulder; or if the direction of
the right rein of support passes in rear of the withers,
the effect is felt by the increased weight on the left
haunch; or if the action of the rein in this direction is
sufficiently strong, it can either lead to the displacement
of the haunches towards the left by setting the left
shoulder, or displace simultaneously the shoulders and
the haunches towards the left by pushing the horse entirely to that side.</p>

<p>The effect of the rein of support is extremely powerful in preventing the horse from slipping out on its side,
or in restraining the horse from turning in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p><em>Rein of Opposition.</em> &mdash; If the rider opens the right
rein slightly and pulls either in the direction of the right
haunch or the direction of the left haunch, the rein is
called the right rein of opposition. He is then said to
set the shoulders in opposition to the haunches. (Notes
d'Equitation.)</p>

<p><em>General Rule:</em>&mdash; A general rule is, that at all times
contact is kept with the mouth by the reins through the
medium of the bit. The reins never flop. There are
two exceptions to this rule allowable: during complete
abandon, as at the walk; and momentarily, during flexions, as will be shown later.</p>

<p></em>The Seat.</em> &mdash; The seat is an aid when it changes the
support of the body from one buttock to the other to
assist the horse in lateral movements. This movement
helps to carry the center of gravity of the horse to the
side toward which the movement is desired. Similarly
an increase in the weight placed on one stirrup is an aid.
The upper part of the body by leaning forward or
back likewise assists the horse in moving the center of
gravity forward and back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>The Forward Movement.</h3>

<p>The horses being now able to be mounted, the following exercises may be undertaken:</p>

<p>The horses are taken into the riding-hall, if available,
and the riders instructed to work without regard to distances. It is a bad plan to work in groups, especially
with young horses, as they soon become accustomed to
remaining in ranks and refuse to leave.</p>

<p>The forward movement, as has been stated, is the
most important lesson in training, and it is continually
taught during the entire course of instruction.</p>

<p><em>The Walk.</em> &mdash; To take the walk from the halt, both
legs should be made to be felt, gradually increasing their
intensity until the setting in motion is produced. The
fingers and wrists give, to allow the neck to stretch out.
The horse should be set in motion in the direction of his axis by symmetrical use of the aids. The movement
should be smooth, but without hesitancy.</p>

<p>In order to keep the start from being sudden, the
energy displayed in the use of the leg should conform to
the degree of sensitiveness of the horse. The movement
can be kept from being hesitatingly performed by progressively, but without hesitancy, using such force as the
legs should have, and by giving the reins with the fingers
and wrist at the precise moment the neck tries to
stretch out.</p>

<p><em>The Trot.</em> &mdash; This is the most advantageous gait to
take during the first lessons, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It starts the horse straight ahead and helps to
bring him in hand.</li>
  <li>'Horses are less restless at this gait.</li>
  <li>It is a natural pace.</li>
  <li>It is a good suppling exercise for the horse.
The trot is not a fatiguing pace to the horse. He
can go a long distance continuously at a fair rate of
speed at this gait, because both fore and hind legs, respectively, have the same amount of work to do, and the
body can be easily maintained in a state of equilibrium,
as it is supported by diagonal supports.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rider, if in the flat saddle, except at slow gaits,
should rise to the trot during this exercise. The diag-
onal on which the rise is made should frequently be
changed.</p>

<p>The lightness of the horse only comes with further
training. The rider up to this point tries little by lit-
tle to bring the horse under control by the following
exercises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moving to the front at a walk, then a trot.</li>
  <li>Increasing and decreasing gaits.</li>
  <li>Halting.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To Halt.</em> &mdash; To execute this movement, lean back
slightly and gradually increase the pressure of the bit
on the mouth until the movement slows down and gradually steps. Roth legs should at the same time be carried
back to assist the horse in bringing the haunches up under
him. The horse should neither raise nor lower his head.
The whole mass of the neck should move toward the
withers.</p>

<p>Halting the horse should often be practiced with
horses possessing a high, powerful croup and with those
inclined to forge ahead at all times. Those inclined to
fret, those whose legs are well set up under them, and
those that are difficult to keep up into the bit should seldom be halted.</p>

<p>Especially during these lessons must the rider pay
strict attention to the even tension of the rein. At first
the rider must do all the work — that is, must tighten the
reins; but later, the horse having become accustomed to
the pressure of the bit and always having the idea of going straight ahead, will of his own accord keep the reins
taut.</p>

<p><em>The Gallop.</em> &mdash; Almost invariably the gallop lesson
should be begun early. This is an additional means of
suppling the horse, of strengthening him, extending him,
and pushing him straight ahead. It would be stupidity
to gallop frequently on a colt that drags his legs and is
disunited at a trot and that has difficulty in holding up
the part essential to the training. On the other hand,
it is proper to gallop repeatedly on a vigorous horse that
has been worked before purchase, or on the horse with
good strong legs, particularly after he has been thorough-
ly confirmed in the correct trot. <i>(Notes d'Equitation.)</i></p>

<p><em>To Take the Gallop by Extending the Trot.</em> &mdash; To accomplish this movement, the rider needs only to take the
trot and by the use of both legs to push this gait up to
the point where the horse leaves it to pass into the gallop.</p>

<p>To accomplish this without undue increase of speed,
put the horse on a circle of six or seven yards radius,
first trot around this and then lengthen the trot until the
horse escapes into the gallop. When he is calm and the
rider feels confidence in himself, the rider may leave the
circle and rejoin the track on the same hand.</p>

<p>As long as the rider does not wish to make abrupt
changes of direction, but gallops on a large circle or on
the track, it makes little difference whether the horse is
galloping true or false, and it is useless for the rider to
bother about the leads at this stage of the training. <i>(De
Saint-Phalle.)</i></p>

<p>When the horse begins to understand the gallop and
takes it calmly, the correct lead, which is explained on
page 61, may be undertaken, at present, by the following
aids: Both legs to increase the gait from the trot to the
gallop; outside rein to prevent the haunches from swinging to the outside and which precludes the liability to a
false lead.</p>

<p><em>(Note. &mdash; "Outside" always means the outside of a
circle, or, if on the track, the side towards the wall.)</em></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>Mechanism of the Gaits.</h3>

<p><em>The Walk.</em> &mdash; This is a movement of four beats, and is a pace in which all the legs move, respectively, one after the other. If, for instance, the left fore leads, the sequence is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Left fore.</li>
  <li>Right hind.</li>
  <li>Right fore.</li>
  <li>Left hind.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the near hind begins, it will be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Left hind.</li>
  <li>Left fore.</li>
  <li>Right hind.</li>
  <li>Right fore.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each foot comes to the ground after the one that
precedes it at an interval of about half the time occupied taking one step. The result of this is that we have the
following order of supports:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right laterals (right fore and right hind).</li>
  <li>Right diagonals (right fore and left hind).</li>
  <li>Left laterals.</li>
  <li>Left diagonals.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a rule, a horse begins the walk with a fore leg.
<em>(Hayes.)</em></p>

<p><em>The Trot.</em> &mdash; This is a movement of two beats. The diagonal feet are on the ground at the same time. The order of supports is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right diagonal.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
  <li>Left diagonal.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>The Pace.</em> &mdash; This is a movement of two beats, like the trot, except the support is by the laterals instead of the diagonals. The order of supports is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right lateral.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
  <li>Left lateral.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>The Gallop.</em> &mdash; The gallop is an unsymmetrical gait of three beats. It is called unsymmetrical because the two front legs make dissimilar movements, likewise the two hind. Two different combinations take place, which are called 'gallop right'' and "gallop left." The moment of taking each new point of support is called a beat.</p>
<p>In the gallop right the points of support are taken in the following order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Left hind.</li>
  <li>Left diagonal (left front, right hind).</li>
  <li>Right front.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
</ol>

<p>The gallop left is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right hind.</li>
  <li>Right diagonal (right front, left hind).</li>
  <li>Left front.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
<ol>

<p>A horse galloping right, for instance, seems to have the right legs always in front of the left. The rider can tell by seeing if the right shoulder is further advanced than the left. If the horse gallops right in front and left behind, the rider can feel an unusual stiff movement be-neath him.</p>

<hr />
  <H2>CHAPTER V.</H2>

  <center>Changes of Direction.</center>

  <p>The horse being able to move forward and to decrease and increase gaits with reasonable accuracy,
  changes of direction may be undertaken.</p>

  <p><em>First Exercise.</em> &mdash; The horse being at the walk, force
  the horse forward with both legs, use the open rein, and
  i{ he moves off at an angle oblique to the original direction, although the divergence may be small, it is
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p><em>Second Exercise.</em> &mdash; The horse being at the walk, use
  the right or left leg to help carry the haunches around
  to the left or right; use the right or left rein of opposition to turn the horse to the right or left in a direction
  perpendicular to the original. The rein of opposition is
  used to combat the haunches with the shoulder. The
  horse cot yet knowing the meaning of the preponderant
  use of one leg of the rider, the shoulder combating the
  haunch will make the haunch swing around, and if the
  horse, every time he is obliged to swing his haunches
  by the rein of opposition, feels the rider's leg on that
  side, he will begin to associate the use of the leg with the
  swinging of the haunches.</p>

  <p><em>Third Exercise.</em> &mdash; As the horse begins to understand the meaning of the use of one leg, gradually lessen
  the use of the rein of opposition as an open rein, until
  it finally becomes a direct rein, used only to turn the head
  slightly in the new direction. As the rein of opposition,
  or open rein, is diminished, supposing it to have been the
  right rein, gradually bring into play the left rein of support to force the fore quarters to the right in the new
  direction. As to the legs: Have both ready to maintain the impulsion, and each ready to act singly in case
  the hind feet do not follow in the track of the fore feet
  in making the change of direction. The hind legs being
  the propellers, and the maximum of power being always
  desirable, for purely mechanical reasons the greatest
  power of the hind legs is obtained when they follow in
  the same path as the forelegs, during turns.</p>

  <p><em>(Note.</em> &mdash; The third exercise should not be undertaken
  until the horse has accomplished most of the exercises
  of Lateral Equitation, explained in following chapters.)</p>

<p>  Abouts, circles, figures of eight, and serpentines are
  exercises, named in order of difficulty, which may be undertaken to accomplish the same result as the above
  exercises, with greater exactness. All these exercises
  should be practiced at the walk until proficient before
  attempting them at the slow trot. The rider sits the
  blow trot.</p>

  <p><em>The About on the Forehand at a Halt.</em> &mdash; With
  horses that are naturally impulsive and are continually
  endeavoring to forge to the front, abouts on the forehand
  from the halt may be practiced at this stage of the training. With horses of exaggerated impulsiveness it may
  sometimes be undertaken earlier. The exercise should
  come later for less impulsive horses. The movement
  should always be completed by moving the horse straight
  to the front. The about on the forehand should always
  be about the inside leg as a pivot, for otherwise the movement is a retrograde one and tends to put the horse behind the bit.</p>

  <p>It must be understood that at this stage of training,
  that is, during lateral equitation (explained on page 50),
  the about on the forehand is not a finished movement.
  The aids to be used are: To execute an about on the
  forehand to the right; both legs to arouse impulsion; the
  right leg to swing the haunches ; the right rein of opposition to assist the right leg; the left rein to assist the
  right in its second function of preventing the horse from
  moving forward. The left leg is always ready to prevent the horse from backing.</p>

<p><em>About on the Forehand (Dismounted).</em> &mdash; With some
  horses that are particularly difficult to teach the use of
  the leg as an aid, dismounted work may be resored to.
  Short lessons only should be given.</p>

<p>Working on the left side, seize the reins six or eight
  inches from the bit in the left hand. Stand facing the
  horse and with the riding-whip touch him in rear of the
  girth where the rider's leg would ordinarily come when
  used as an aid. Increase the force of the whip, beginning with light taps, until the horse swings his haunches
  away from the whip. The left hand prevents the horse
  moving either forward or backward. If at first the
  horse fails to move his haunches, he may be assisted in
  doing so by bringing the head slightty toward the side
  of the trainer. This opposes the head to the haunches
  and assists the action of the whip.</p>

  <hr/>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<h2><center> CHAPTER. VI.</center></h2>


<center>Outdoor Work.</center>

<p>From the moment the horse will go straight ahead
outdoor work is in some cases a necessity and in all cases
to a greater or less extent desirable. </p>

<p>Horses which tend to get behind the bit or which do
not let themselves out should frequently have outside
work alternated with hall work. The horse being grad-
ually educated to a good free trot should be given them
outdoors, allowing time enough between trots for the
horse to assume normal breathing. Outdoor work should
take place with normal horses two days a week.</p>

<p>All horses need fresh outdoor air occasionally.</p>

<p>Horses that are inclined to bolt or forge ahead con-
tinually, or those that throw most of the weight on the
forehand, need much more hall work than outdoor work.</p>

<p>Young horses especially should be given trots on
soft ground. No horse should be galloped on hard roads.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Soft ground means turf or dirt roads, not plowed land
or stone-built roads. The gallop is undertaken outdoors
only when the horse can be made to lead from either foot.</p>

<p>By going in pairs nervous horses do not fret while
outdoors, as much as though alone. It is likewise bet-
ter not to maintain a formation in ranks while outdoors,
any more than necessary, in order to prevent the new
horses from acquiring the habit of going in ranks and
refusing to leave.</p>

<p>During the last part of outdoor exercise the horse
should be walked so that he is returned to the stable
breathing normally.</p>

<h2><center>CHAPTER VII.</center></h2>



<center> Suppling Exercises with Body Bent.</center>

<p><em>Different Kinds of Equitation.</em> &mdash; When, for example,
the right rein and right leg are used to assist each other
in moving the haunches, it is called lateral equitation.
When the reins place the forehand and the legs alone
control the hindhand, as, for example, if the left rein and
right leg are used, it is called diagonal equitation.</p>

<center>Lateral Equitation.</center>

<p>The following points should he considered during
the exercises in lateral equitation :
<ol>
<li> One step taken correctly is at first all that should
be expected or required.</li>

<li> As the movements are fatiguing, they should at
no time be continued more than a few seconds.</li>

<li> Horses that are stiff on one particular side
should be suppled by exercises to that side.</li>


<li> The preceding rule applies to all parts of the
horse except the neck. If the neck is stiff on the right
side, supple it by exercises, as ''Shoulder In" (see below).
on the left hand. <em>(Capt. Short.)</em></li>

<li> The movements are all begun at a walk and
when proficient in them, are executed at a slow trot.</li>

<li> When the movements are executed on a circle,
where the fore quarters are on one circumference and the
hind quarters either on a larger or a smaller circumfer-
ence, the effect, besides being one of suppling, is as fol-
lows: When the haunches are on a smaller circumfer-
ence the horse tends toward collection, his hind quarters
tend to come up under the body, and it is a good move-
ment for a horse that forges ahead ; when the hind quart-
ers are on a circle of greater circumference than the fore
quarters the horse tends to be forced up into the bit and
to stretch out behind, hence it is a useful movement with
sluggish horses or horses that tend to get behind the bit.</li>

<li> When executing any of the following exercises,
if the horse fails to respond to the action of both legs
and does not go up into the bit, cease the exercise at once
and move straight ahead at a trot or gallop and do not
return to the exercise until the horse is again into the bit.</li>

</ol>

<p><em>First Exercise in Suppling the Haunches.</em> &mdash; This les-
son consists in abouts on the forehand while marching.
For example, marching on the right hand, leave the track
on a diagonal (oblique) and return to it by a half turn to
the left exacted by a very pronounced action of the left
leg and left rein. This strongly marked lateral effect
carries the horse's haunches to the right ; that is to say.
the horse while still gaining ground yields to the effect
of the leg (and left rein), and thus describes a half turn.
The same movement is executed while marching on the
left hand and the horse eventually swings the haunches
easily about the forehand, without halting, without strik-
ing the fetlocks, and without dancing. (<em>Notes d'Equi-
tation.</em>)</p>

<p>The commands for this exercise are:</p>
<ol>
<li> Right oblique.</li>

<li> <em>March.</em></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> On forehand.</li>

<li> Half turn in reverse.</li>

<li> <em>March</em>.</li>


</ol>
<hr/>


<p>"Half turn" and "reverse" could, in this case, be
expressed "left half turn," but "in reverse" has partic-
ular significance, and the terms should be retained on that
account.</p>

<p><em>Haunches In.</em> &mdash; This movement is one to exact obe-
dience to one leg while marching. It continues the sup-
pling of the hind quarters and confirms the obedience
to the leg. It should be undertaken only when the horse
yields readily to the legs in previous exercises.</p>

<p>Marching on the right hand, use the left rein of op-
position and the left leg. It is sufficient if the horse
swings his haunches to the right so that the left hind foot
steps on a line passing through the prints of the right fore
foot. The left rein of opposition assists the action of
the left leg. At first one step is sufficient to demand at
a time. Repeat the movement several times, gradually
demanding more steps in the correct position. Never de-
mand the movement, at any one time, over a greater dis-
tance than the long side of the riding hall. The follow-
ing cautions should be carefully observed:</p>



<hr/>
<ol>
<li> Never let the horse's body make an angle of
more than 45 degrees with the original direction. To
prevent this, use the inside leg.</li>

<li> Never let the gait diminish. To prevent this,
use both legs when necessary to demand impulsion.</li>

<li> Do not lean to the left when moving to the right.
The weight of the body should be slightly more upon the
right buttock when moving to the right.</li>

<li> Do not let the right rein be slack when moving
to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Shoulder In.</em> &mdash; This is a similar exercise to haunches
in, but more difficult and more useful.</p>

<p>This movement supples both forehand and hindhand.</p>

<p>To execute the movement when marching on the
right hand:</p>

<p>First use the right open rein and the left rein of
support, the fore quarters are then moved off the track
and the head turned to the right ; the right leg is then used
to push the mass from right to left and the left leg to
receive the swinging of the haunches and to control the
impulsion.</p>


<hr/>

<p><em>Cautions to Be Observed:</em></p>
<ol>
<li> During the first lessons, after the fore quarters
have been moved off the track, to facilitate the movement
along the track, the outside rein may be slightly opened.</li>

<li> The reins prevent the lateral flexion of the neck
at the shoulders by holding the head firmly between them.</li>

<li> The fore quarters are sufficiently removed from
the track if the left fore foot and right hind travel along
the same path parallel to the track.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<hr />
<hr />

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Diagonal Equitation.</p>

<p>Exercises with Body Straight.</p>

<p><em>General Rules for Diagonal Equitation:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Perfection is gained when the body of the horse: from the poll back is in a straight line.</li>
  <li>The horse's head is always turned slightly at the poll to enable him to see in the direction he is going.</li>
  <li>The reins set or place the forehand.</li>
  <li>The legs govern the hindhand.</li>
  <li>The green horse is never passaged directly to the right or left. The direction of motion should not be more than 45 degrees from the direction of the axis of the horse.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Work on Two Tracks.</em> &mdash; This movement consists in

displacing the horse parallel to himself in a direction ob lique to that of his axis, the front and hind legs describing four parallel tracks. The exterior members cross over the interior ones.</p>

<p>The following are the aids in order to move a horse on two tracks to the right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Both legs, if sufficient momentum is not already obtained, should send the horse up into the bit to receive the indications of the reins.</li>
  <li>The right direct rein makes the horse look to the side toward which he should march, and by throwing the weight slightly to the right begins the displacement of the center of gravity towards the right.- The left rein of support acts at the same time as the preceding, to in-sure the lateral displacement of the forehand to the right by further displacing the center of gravity.</li>
  <li>The left leg, at this moment, becomes prepond-erant in order to direct the haunches to the right, while the right leg acts if necessary to limit the displacement of the haunches, and to oblige the horse to maintain his gait and to gain ground to the front as well as to the side.</li>
  <li>The seat is displaced towards the right to aid the horse's movement to that side. <em>(De Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The following are exercises on two tracks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks, Haunches In.</em> &mdash; A two-track movement along the track, with the head to the wall, in which the haunches move on an inside track, the horse heing in the position described above for the work on two tracks and being governed by similar aids.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks, Haunches Out.</em> &mdash; Same as above, except the croup is to the wall and the fore quarters move on an inside track, the hind quarters on the track.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks on the Diagonal.</em> &mdash; A movement in which a horse moves across the hall on the diagonal on two tracks.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks on a Circle.</em> &mdash; Described by its name. The haunches being on a smaller or larger circle than the fore quarters. The same principles apply in each case as described for work on two tracks.</li>
</ol>

<p><Center>Commands.</Center></p>
<p><em>For First Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches in.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Second Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches out.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Third Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Right oblique.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Fourth Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches in (or out).</li>
  <li>March. <em>(Footnote to Saummur Notes.)</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>About on the Forehand at a Halt.</em> &mdash; To execute this movement from left to right the aids are as folows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Carry the weight of the mass over the shoulders by the equal action of both legs.</li>
  <li>Just the horse is about to move out, close the fingers on the reins and prevent further advance.</li>
  <li>Use the right rein of support to bring the weight upon the left shoulder.</li>
  <li>Use the left direct rein to turn the horse's head to the left at the poll.</li>
  <li>Use the left leg to move the haunches to the right.</li>
  <li>The right leg remains ready to maintain the advanced position of the center of gravity and likewise to limit the movement of the haunches to that side.</li>
  <li>The seat should be carried to the right to facil-itate the displacement of the haunches to that side.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>About on the Haunches.</em> &mdash; This movement is more difficult than the about on the forehand and should be undertaken only after the work on two tracks is well understood.</p>

<p>The movement is first taught by moving the horse on two tracks on a small circle; for example, to the right, with haunches in.</p>

<p>Gradually decrease the diameter of the circle as the horse becomes proficient. As the circle becomes smaller change the direction of the rein so that the direction of the pull is toward the right haunche to weight the latter d wn. Likewise increase the pressure of the left leg un-til it is sufficient to prevent little by little any movement on the part of the haunches. The circle then is finally diminished so that the movement is that of a circle on the part of the forehand about the right hind leg as a
pivot. If the movement should be about the left hind leg, or outside leg, as a pivot, it becomes a retrograde movement, which is liable to put the horse behind the bit.</p>

<p><em>The Gallop.</em> &mdash; Heretofore the gallop has been undertaken merely as a means cf exercise tj strengthen and stretch out the hone and to teach him a little in balanc-ing himself by the use of his legs. No attention was paid at first to the leads; later a little lateral equitation was used to partially insure the correct lead.</p>

<p>A horse is leading correctly when the right laterals (right front and right hind) are in advance of the left laterals, when turning to the right. This is called "lead-ing right." A horse is galloping disunited when he is galloping one way in front and another way in rear.</p>

<p>On small circles or sudden turns of direction a horse is liable to fall if not leading correctly.</p>

<p><em>The Right Lead.</em> &mdash; To require a horse to lead to the right, the aids are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Weight of the body to the left, weight in left stirrup in order to weight down the left haunch.</li>
  <li>Use of the left leg to cause the haunches to be displaced to the right, consequently requiring the right lateral to pass the left.
  <li>Use of the right leg to join its action to that of the left to give the necessary impulsion and to receive the haunches and prevent their being moved too far to the right. The horse being driven by the legs up into the bit, is received by the reins in the following manner:</li>
  <li>Right rein of support exerted in a direction to-ward the left shoulder to weight the latter, for it must be slowed down ; at the same time this movement frees the right shoulder and allows it to extend itself. The horse is made to slightly turn the head to the right at the poll in order that he may see in the direction in which he is going.</li>
  <li>Left direct rein corroborates the action of the right and keeps the neck straight. </em>(De Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>
  <li>If the gallop is taken from the trot while post-ing, rising with the right diagonal assists the right lead. Rising from the left diagonal assists the left lead.
  When perfection is attained, the horse does not perceptibly swing his haunches to the right or left.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p><small><em>*Note.</em> &mdash; For paragraphs 4 and 5 the following paragraphs, showing a method of using the reins, may he substituted. This method is taught by some of the best authorities in our service. It certainly can be reasoned out as well as that mentioned above, it is more easy to put in practice and produces results in a scientific manner.</small></p>
<small>
<ol>
  <li>Use the left direct rein to weight the left Shoulder.</li>
  <li>Exert sufficient pressure on the right rein to keep the head from being turned to the left, so that the horse may see where he is going, and at the same time raise the right hand slightly to assist in lightening the weight on the right shoulder, thereby assisting to free it.</li>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>Backing.</h3>

<p>This exercise is a suppling one for back and haunches, and is especially applicable to horses who have difficulty in bringing the hind legs under the body. It is an
exercise which to the unskillful is dangerous, as it tends
to put a horse behind the bit. To the skillful it is of
course less dangerous, yet it should not be undertaken
by either until this point in the education of the horse
is reached, provided he be normal. With horses that are
very difficult to hold, or are continually b king, backing
exercises may be undertaken earlier in the training. </p>

<p>The movement may be advantageously taught distincted at first.</p>

<p><em>Teaching the Backward Movement, Dismounted.</em> &mdash;
The trainer stands facing the horse. He takes the reins
one in each hand and slightly lowers the head to relieve
the weight on the hind quarters. He then makes a slight
movement with his hands towards his own body, sufficient to prepare the horse to move forward. As the
horse is about to move out the trainer presses directly
toward the horse with the bit until the horse takes a step
to the rear. One step at first is sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few lessons of this, the trainer steps to the
left side of the horse, with the reins in the left hand, the
riding-whip in the right. He stimulates the hind quarters with a light touch of the whip, and as the horse starts
to move his iiind quarters up under his body he urges
him to take a step to the rear by the pressure of the bit.
As soon as he takes a step or two as desired, he leads him
forward.</p>

<p><em>Mounted.</em> &mdash; When the horse can perform the last
exercise well, mount him. Use the aids required to
move the horse to the front; then, just as he is about to
move out, increase the pressure of the reins and lean
slightly back until the horse steps to the rear. As soon
as the horse at first has taken a single step to the rear he
should be moved straight to the front. Later several
steps to the rear may be required, but a movement to the
front always follows the last step. If difficulty is at any
time encountered in moving the horse forward after the
backward movement, backing should cease as an exercise
until the horse is sent up into the bit again.</p>

<p>If the horse sets himself, move him forward a step
or two, and as he is moving exert the aids for the backward movement until he obeys. Moving a horse's
haunches laterally will help to prevent a horse from setting himself and refusing to back.</p>

<p>This exercise should not be repeated often in a single day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<h4>The Double Bridle.</h4>

<p>The horse that can perform successfully the fore-
going exercises, that has found his balance while moving
forward, that is easy to control by the aids at the walk
and trot, and that has learned the use of his legs in ac-
complishing a good walk, trot, and gallop, is ready for
the double bridle. It normally takes about three months
to accomplish this.</p>

<p><em>Definition.</em> &mdash; The double bridle is one with usually
four cheek straps, which fasten, one into the eye of the
curb bit, the other into the ring of the snaffle bit.</p>

<p>The curb bit is nearer the front of the horse's mouth
than the snaffle, and the curb chain likewise passes in
front of the snaffle bit.</p>


<p><em>The Severity of the Curb Bit Increases &mdash; </em></p>
<ol>
<li> With the difference between the length of the
upper and lower branches.</li>

<li> With the tightness of the curb chain.</li>

<li> With the height of the port.</li>

<li> Inversely With the size of the canons. <em>(De
Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>

</ol>

<p>Bits with branches similar in length to the U. S. rej-
ulation bit are arranged below in order of mildness:</p>

<ol>

<li> The broken curb bit. (Like a snaffle bit, but
with upper and lower branches and curb chain.)</li>

<li> Rubber- and leather-covered bits.</li>

<li> The straight bar bit.</li>

<li> The regulation bit. </li>

</ol>

<p><em>Kinds.</em> &mdash; The "Weymouth" or "Pump" bit is quite
universally used for polo. Why it is considered effica-
cious for polo especially is not known. It is a good bit,
except the lips are liable to become pinched.</p>

<p>The "Pelham" is a bit provided with rings for the
snaffle rein at the junction of the canon with the branch-
es. The action of the curb reins on this bit does not
produce the same effect, when the snaffle reins are used
at the same time, as it does on a curb bit, where the snaf-
fle reins are attached to a separate snaffle bit.</p>

<p>It is a general rule to follow, that all complicated
bits are useless, and that with a well-trained horse the
mildest bit that will insure obedience is the correct one.</p>

<h3>Schedule for Accustoming the Horse to the
Curb Bit.</h3>

<p>The reins are held in both hands, snaffle reins out-
side the little fingers.</p>
<ol>

<li> Use the curb bit without curb chain until the
horse becomes accustomed to it.</li>

<li>Use the mildest bit available and fasten the curb
chain loosely. At first, only move on straight lines until
the horse takes the bit quietly, then execute simple ex-
ercises in which the horse is proficient. These exercises
at first are begun on the snaffle bit.</li>

<li>Use the bit best adapted to the horse, and set
the curb chain to keep the bit from falling through.</li>

</ol>

<p>Work mainly on the snaffle bit until the horse becomes
accustomed to the bit and curb chain.</p>

<p>The preceding movements should be begun at first
at a slow gait.</p>

<p><em>Use.</em> — The curb bit is used primarily, in training, to
lower the head, to flex the jaw, and to bring the nose in
towards the body.</p>

<p>The snaffle bit raises the head and supports the horse.</p>

<p>A curb bit will not stop a horse that makes up his to bolt.</p>

<p>A curb bit roughly used may cause a horse to make
up his mind to bolt.</p>

<p>A "hard mouth" is often a tender mouth accustomed
to hard hands.</p>

<p><em>The Curb Bit ''Gathers'' the Horse.</em> &mdash; A horse is
gathered when his head and neck are well raised, the
front line of the face nearly vertical, and the jaw and
the junction of the head and neck at the poll flexible.</p>

<p>A horse in a state of "collection" is in a position to
obey, to the utmost of his capability, any demands the aids
may give.</p>


<p>A horse is in "collection" when he is gathered and
his hind legs are well up under the body.</p>

<p>When a horse is collected, the rider, by having omit-
ted bending the neck near the shoulders during training,
has the neck firm on the shoulders and not flexible or
"rubber-necked." Hence the rider acts on the neck
through the mouth and on the shoulders through the
neck. The hind quarters by being under the horse bind
themselves to the forehand. The rider then by acting
on the forehand acts likewise upon the hind quarters.</p>

<p>The entire body of the horse should be, if properly
collected, an energetic and harmonious whole. The
horse is "in hand," because his jaw is flexible and he
yields to the effects of the bit. The horse is light or
handy, because he is balanced by continual training and
because his center of gravity is equally near both front
and hind quarters; hence the proper movement on the
part of the rider will disturb this balance in any direc-
tion desired.</p>

<p>The rider at this point, being supposed to be able to
get the hind legs up under the horse, must learn to gath-
er him.</p>


<p>To gather the horse involves:</p>
<ol>

<li> Direct flexion (the flexion of the jaw and head
in the direction of the axis of the horse).</li>

<li> Lateral flexion (the flexion of the neck at the
poll in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the horse).</li>

</ol>
<p> <em>Direct Flexion.</em> &mdash; Direct flexion is the concession the
head and lower jaw of the horse make in the vertical
plane of the axis of the horse when the action of the
reins arrest the extension of the neck. The giving of the
neck is confined to the upper portion; the front line of
the face is made to approach a vertical line and the head
is made to make in an almost imperceptible manner a
movement analogous to a nod. </p>

<p>The giving of the jaw consists in opening the mouth,
causing complete abandon of the bit, followed immediate
ly by the closing of the mouth and the taking up of con-
tact with the bit again.</p>

<p>To flex the jaw in direct flexion, first start the horse
into a walk. Never let the gait slacken during flexion.
Close the legs. When the horse goes up into the bit,
close one hand on one snaffle rein I if the movement is
done with a snaffle bit), or close the hand on both curb
reins. Do not make the pressure of long duration if re-
sistance is encountered. Alternate the action, first by
releasing, then increasing the pressure. This is more
uncomfortable to the horse than continued pressure, and
he will soon yield.</p>

<p>The head is flexed in direct flexion so that it is set
with the front line of the face nearly vertical by the action
of both curb reins. The head and neck are raised by the
snaffle bit, should they be lowered too much.</p>

<p><em>Lateral Flexion.</em> &mdash; Lateral flexion is a concession
which the head and neck make by turning the head to
the right or to the left when an opposing action of the
reins stops an extension of the neck. The jaw gives
in lateral flexion as in direct flexion. The neck gives by
making the head make a turn of a quarter of a circle to
the right or left at the poll.</p>

<p>Lateral flexion should be demanded, in the begin-
ning, at the walk. To obtain it, to the right, for exam-
ple: first, resistance must be offered by the right direct
rein, which leads the head into the desired position; the
left rein then acts to limit this movement and to work
together with the right rein to obtain the concession oi
the jaw.</p>

<p>Flexion may be made dismounted, if absolutely im-
possible of execution mounted.</p>

<p><em>Direct Flexion Dismounted. </em> &mdash; Stand on the near side
of the horse. Take the snaffle reins off the neck over
the horse's head and hold them a few inches in front of
his head with the left hand. Urge the horse forward
into a walk and raise the head sightly to the proper ele-
vation with the snaffle reins : When the horse moves out
at the walk, take the curb reins in the right hand and as-
similate the movement of the reins as though flexing the
jaw mounted. Do not let the horse slacken speed or, at
any cost, back up.</p>

<p><em>Lateral Flexion Dismounted. </em> &mdash; Stand on the near
side, with the snaffle rein held as for direct flexion. Ex-
ecute direct flexion and when performed lead the horse's
head to the right with a snaffle rein, increasing the pres-
sure of the right curb rein slightly until the head is turned
to the right at the poll. Do not let the horse move back-
ward, nor let the neck flex in rear of the poll. The max-
imum movement of the head is over an arc of a circle
of 90 degrees.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<center>Jumping.</center>

<p>Jumping is an exercise which when properly under-taken is most instructive and productive of good results to both man and horse.</p>

<center>Mechanism of the Jump for Height.</center>

<center>(Jumping from the Gallop Left.)</center>

<ol>
  <li>As the left fore foot is about to leave the ground, just before the moment of suspension of the gallop, the leg, especially the fetlock joint, is straightened.</li>
  <li>The head and neck are elevated. The above movement raises the forehand.</li>
  <li>Just as the left foot is raised the two hind legs are brought up to a place on the ground about where the left fore foot was.</li>
  <li>The hind legs are straightened out. Due to the last movement, the horse completely
leaves the ground and takes the obstacle, with fore and hind legs bent.</li>
  <li>The horse lands on the left fore foot, legs straight.</li>
  <li>The right fore foot, leg straight, is then brought to the support.</li>
  <li>The left fore foot is picked up.</li>
  <li>The right fore foot is picked up and simulta-neously the left hind comes to the ground.</li>
  <li>The right hind comes to the ground. The horse then is galloping right after landing. </li>
</ol>

<p>The horse leaps from a trot from one front leg and both hind legs. The leap is more difficult, as it is impossible at a trot to get both hind legs side by side up under the body to &#8243;take of.&#8243;</p>

<p>From the walk and halt, the horse in jumping first rears, then straightens out his hind legs.</p>

<p>As jumping for height at a gallop is the easiest for a horse, and as the principles encountered apply equally well to the other gaits, the following deductions are made from the mechanism at the gallop, as explained in previous paragraphs:</p>

<p>From Paragraph i : As the distance from the jump to the place where the left leg leaves the ground is of the utmost importance to the horse, he should be allowed to gauge his stride while approaching the jump.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 2: As the head and neck are raised to assist in raising the fore quarters, the rider's body should not lean forward of the perpendicular, for this would hinder the movement. As the horse's object is to lighten the fore quarters, it follows that great speed is a detriment to a horse in jumping, for the more speed the more weight upon the forehand. Raising the head and neck necessitates lengthening the reins at the moment of extension, or letting them slide through the fingers. It follows then, that, as a false movement of the hand with a severe bit causes greater injury than one with a snaffle bit, a snaffle bit should be used in jumping until proficiency is obtained.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 3 : To facilitate the bringing well up under the body of the hind leg, the rider's legs must be carried back.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 5 : The weight of the rider's body must set to the rear to assist the horse by lightening the load on the forehand while landing. If a severe bit or a hard hand pulls the head in and bends the neck while the horse is in this position, by cramping the muscles of the neck the horse is prevented from stretching his legs to the front to insure a safe landing.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 7: If the rider's weight is forward or he is thrown upon the horse's neck while the horse is landing, the extra weight on the forehand prevents the fore leg being picked up and causes over-reaching. Ex-treme speed has the same effect with the same result.</p>

<p>From Paragraphs 8 and 9: It is seen that the horse is galloping with the other lead after landing. In jump-ing in the riding-hall care should be exercised at the cor-ner beyond the jump if at the gallop, for, if galloping correctly at the start, the horse is galloping false after the jump.</p>

<p><em>Teaching the Horse to Jump.--</em>Place a bar upon the ground and lead the horse over it at a walk. When the horse executes this movement correctly, raise the bar to about two feet and jump the horse upon the longe.</p>

<p><em>To Jump a Horse on the Longe.--</em>First instruct the horse sufficiently upon the longe until he goes equally well on either hand. Approach the jump, the horse cir-cling on the longe on the left hand, for instance. The trainer holds the longe in the left hand so that it can be allowed to run out with ease; the longeing-whip is held in the right hand. Circle the horse near the jump until the horse goes quietly. The circles are made slightly in rear of the jump. When the horse is quiet, move so that the jump will intercept the circle the horse is making. As the horse approaches the jump the trainer, with the longe fairly taut, likewise approaches the end of the bar nearest him, keeping the longeing-whip held in rear of the horse. Urge the horse with the whip, if necessary, until lie jumps. After taking off, let the longe run through the ringers so as not to yank the horse or bring him up short. When the horse does well, stop him and caress him or give him carrots or oats.</p>

<p>Jumping should be begun at first at the walk, then at the trot and gallop. The horse jumping for the first time gauges his stride more easily at the walk.</p>

<p>A bar may be placed two or three feet from the ground in the opening of the corral fence, etc., so that the horses that have been worked at jumping on the longe may be thus intercepted by an easy jump on their way to the corral or to some such place to which they are desirous of going. A man with a longeing whip stands ready to urge on any that refuse. This jump should be stiff and helps to prepare horses for outdoor jumping.</p>

<p><em>Riding the Horse Over the Jump.--</em>The horse being able to jump with sufficient accuracy, on the longe, is mounted. First, he is ridden over the bar on the ground. Then over the bar gradually raised to suit the horse.</p>

<p>On taking a horse up to the jump the following are essential points to remember:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rider must make up his mind that he is going to make the horse jump.</li>
  <li>He must have confidence in his balance and not stiffen his muscles.</li>
  <li>He must increase the grip with his knees and the calves of his legs and keep his hands low.</li>
  <li>The rider must have the horse well in hand and must remember that if a horse attempts to slip out to the left, the use of the right rein, to turn the head to the right, helps the horse to go to the left by freeing the left shoulder. The rein of support is the one which should be used, together with whichever leg will straighten the horse so that he is perpendicular to his jump.</li>
</ol>

<p>Horses are more easily controlled in the riding-hall, but jump with more freedom outdoors. Outdoor jumping should be taken up as soon as the horse learns to jump moderately well indoors.</p>

<p><em>Jumping for Breadth.--</em>This is a more difficult jump to teach a new horse, because he is more fearful of a ditch than of a fence. From the nature of the jump, it can only be taught outdoors. The method of instruction is the same as for jumping for height.</p>

<p>As the momentum acquired by speed is essential to carry the horse's body across an open ditch, greater speed is necessary than in jumping for height. Excessive speed, however, so weights down the forehand that it becomes difficult for the horse to raise his forehand sufficiently to clear the ditch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p> <center>The Change of Lead at the Gallop.</center> </p>

<p>This movement is to be undertaken when the horse is capable of taking the desired lead from a trot on a straight line.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put the horse on a circle of large radius, at a galiop. Leave the circle by a line parallel to the diagonal of the riding-hall and form another large circle to the opposite hand, keeping the same lead at the gallop as on the first circle. Galloping on the second circle with the same lead as on the first is galloping "false." Besides lowering the croup and balancing the horse, the false lead impresses the aids upon the horse, because to maintain a false lead the aids used- on the first circle must be more strongly used on the second.</li>
  <li>Gallop the horse on a straight line, leading right. Bring him down to a trot, previously having changed the aids to gallop left, which assists in bringing the horse to the trot and prepares the way for the next move. As soon as the trot is taken, increase the aids of gallop left, increase the impulsion, and send the horse into gallop left, with only a few steps of the trot intervening be-tween gallops. Gradually, as the horse becomes proficient, decrease the number of steps taken at the trot.</li>
  <li>When the amount of trot required between changes of lead is hardly more than a slackening of speed, or "half halt," make a large circle to the right at the gallop, leading right. Leave the circle on the diag-onal, as before, and make another circle to the left, hold-ing the right lead. Change the aids, while on the second circle, to gallop left, without coming to the trot, and force the horse into the change of lead.</li>
  <li>When the horse can accomplish the above, at-tempt the change of aids and force the change of lead on the straight line without diminishing the gait.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above movements are very difficult to accom-plish smoothly and correctly. The change of aids must not be accomplished roughly and the aids must be used with only the intensity required to change the lead, there-by not forcing the horse to increase of speed.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Although all horses are different one from another,
the preceding rules generally apply. The rider who appreciates the needs of his horse is the one most likely to
succeed in training.</p>

<p>To many, the expenditure of six months in training
troop horses by these methods seems unnecessary and
impracticable. With experienced men and amenable
boises the time may be slightly reduced. A horse cannot be hurried, and slipshod, careless training is often
worse than none.</p>

<p>As it has been found entirely practical to follow out
this course with enlisted men on remounts at a regimental post, it is to be hoped that heavy, hard-gaited, uncomfortable horses to ride will soon disappear from the
ranks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>Equilibrium.</h3>

<p>A little must be understood about equilibrium before
the aids can properly be mastered.</p>

<p><em>Direct Equilibrium.</em> &mdash; This relates to the balance of
the horse when the center of gravity is moved forward
or backward. The fore legs of the horse are used for
translation, (the Hind legs for propulsion. The horse
naturally bears more weight upon his fore legs than upon
his hind. The center of gravity, then, is nearer the fore
quarters than the hind, which is therefore favorable to
the forward movement of the horse.</p>

<p>If the weight of the horse, by changing the position
of parts of the body, brings the center of gravity towards the rear, it is more favorable for the backward
movement.</p>

<p>When the center of gravity is forward, the forelegs
control the movement of the mass, and the hind legs
merely propel. When the center of gravity moves back-
ward, the hind legs become more and more masters of
the control of the movement of the mass, and their ac-
tion then is from the ground up as well as from rear to
front as before. In other words, the movements gain
in height.</p>

<p><em>Position of a Horse for the Forward Movement. &mdash;</p></em>
<ol>
  <li> When a horse wants to move forward, he naturally puts himself in the most favorable position; consequently he throws his weight forward to his shoulders,
    and, to do this, stretches out his head and neck.</li>

  <li> To obtain the forward movement and the accelerations in gait then, the rider must let the horse extend and lower his head and neck; similarly he must
    raise them to obtain the slower gaits.</li>

  <li> <em>A horse must always be ready to carry himself
    forward.</em> This is the most important rule in equitation.
    The tendency to move forward is called "impulsion."
    Without impulsion we can have no influence over the
    direction. (<em>De Saint-Phalle.</em>)</li>
</ol>




<p>The horse must go into the bridle. Nearly every
vice and resistance offered by a horse is preceded and
made possible by the animal getting behind the bit; that
is, he refuses to lace the bit, or take the pressure of the
bit, so that the rider's hand can find nothing by which
he can enforce his demands. (<em>Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p><em>Lateral Equilibrium.</em> &mdash; This relates to the balance of
a horse when the center of gravity is moved sideways.
It is a case where the horse is made to load one shoulder
or one haunch or all one side more than the other. It
is used for changes of direction, parallel displacements,
etc. The horse being in motion, if we force him to carry the weight of his forehand to one side, the entire fore
hand tends to be displaced to the same side. This displacement of the horse is obligatory if that of the center
of gravity is sufficiently accentuated.</p>

<center>The Aids.</center>
<p><em>What Are the Aids?</em> &mdash; The aids are the different
means employed by the rider to convey his desires or
intentions to the horse. (Notes d'Equitation.)</p>



<center>The Legs.</center>

<p><em>The Stirrups.</em> &mdash; The stirrups should be so adjusted
that the tread of the stirrup is level with the top of the
heel when the rider is mounted and seated properly.
When the stirrups are too long, as with the "fork seat,"
the rider is unable to use his legs with strength and accuracy. With the stirrups too short the rider's knees are
too high, the seat is forced too far back and he is unable
to sit down in the saddle; hence is less secure.</p>

<p><em>Position of the Foot in the Stirrup.</em> &mdash; At least one-
third of the foot should be inserted in the stirrup; the
1st heel should be slightly lower than the toe and the ball
of the foot should rest upon the tread. (Notes d'Equitation.)</p>

<p>The following are the uses to which the legs
are put.</p>
<ol>

<p><li> To produce the forward movement.</p></li>

<p><li> To range the haunches.</p></li>

<p><li> To bring the hind legs forward under the body.</li>
  </ul>

<p><em>The Equal Action of Both Legs.</em> &mdash; The most important duty of the legs is to act together for the purpose of
giving or sustaining impulsion. This action should command the forward movement and its acceleration. To
obtain this result, the legs can act by simple pressure of
the knees or by pressure of the knees and calves. The
pressure of only the knees is sufficient with delicate
horses, but with others the pressure of the calves has to
be added to that of the knees. The more energetic the
pressure and the farther behind the girths it is, the greater the result produced. Usually the action of the leg is
strong enough if it is placed against or a little in rear
of the girth. If the action there is not sufficient, it
may be carried back a little &mdash; never, however, to reach
an angle of 45 degrees. The perfection to aim at is to
have the leg move almost imperceptibly and vary its effects only by different shades of pressure; but with a
horse that does not respond sufficiently to the demands,
it becomes necessary to carry the leg back a little by
bending the knee and keeping the heels low. The inclination of the leg to an angle of 45 degrees is the very
maximum, which it is unscientific and useless to pass or
even to reach, so that if the action of the leg is not efficacious under these conditions, we must turn to more
energetic methods. But little trouble is experienced in
teaching riders not to carry the legs too far back. The
reverse is usually the case.</p>

<p>The above method failing, the next to try is consecutive thumpings with the calf of the leg, not very pronounced, but repeated until the result sought is obtained.
At the instant the legs should cease their action, and
should repeat it only when the need again is felt.</p>

<p>If this means is not sufficient, there is nothing to do
but come to blows with the legs. These are executed
by slightly carrying to one side the calf and ramming
it against the horse with a violence proportionate to the
result to be obtained. This movement ought to be done
without raising the knees or sticking them out, the lower
part of the legs being independent of the rest of the body
in order that the seat and the hand be not deranged.
This manner of getting action upon the horse ought not
to be continued for a long time, even if its effect is not
sufficient or lasting. Like every violent movement, this
one ought to be exceptional, and rather than repeat it
frequently, it is better to have recourse to short, energetic action of the spurs.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to avoid the frequent fault of
using the leg after sufficient action has been gotten out
of the horse or of continuing the demands when they are
already obeyed. Then the impulsion of the horse is augmented in a manner prejudicial to the desired result,
which necessitates the action of the hand to oppose the
augmented impulsion falsely ordered by the legs.</p>

<p><em>Unequal Action of the Legs.</em> &mdash; When one leg is used
more than the other, the haunches are displaced to the
opposite side. The horse is then said "to range his
haunches." This effect is often useful in preventing the
horse from slipping out sideways, in straightening him,
and in making him change directions, etc.; but its greatest utility lies in permitting the rider to range the haunches and traverse the horse, which movements are essential
to the main instruction in the mental and physical suppling of the horse.</p>

<p>The rules for the use of both legs apply equally well
to the use of one leg, as regards place of contact and
manner of graduating the intensity of action. ("Equal
Action of Both Legs and Unequal Action of the Leg,"
from "Elementary Equitation," by De Saint-Phalle.)</p>

<p><em>To Bring the Hind Legs Forward Under the
Horse.</em> &mdash; Due to contraction of the muscles produced by
the tickling sensation of the leg or spur upon the side,
the horse mechanically brings his hind legs up under the
body when so forced. This bringing up of the hind legs
places the control of the movement of the mass in their
power, because the center of gravity is nearer their base.
Hence the leg movements become more elevated, the
speed less fast, and the horse more handy and more easily controlled.</p>

<p>Mutual Support by the Legs. &mdash; If one leg acts to
range the haunches, the other should receive the mass to
limit and control the movement. Both legs should be at
all times close enough to the horse to act accurately,
quickly, and without abruptness in order to assist each
other.</p>

<p><em>When a Horse Is "Behind the Legs." </em> &mdash; When a horse
refuses to move forward after the equal action of both
legs is produced, he is said to be "behind the bit" and like
wise "behind the legs." A horse in this state is beyond
the control of the rider, and every means should be exerted to force the horse with the legs up into the bit
again.</p>

<p><em>The Spur.</em> &mdash; The spur should not be used until the
seat is secure. If the pressure of the calves of the legs
is sufficient to command impulsion, the spur should not
be resorted to.</p>

<p>Resistances are provoked if the spur remains in the
side continuously, and the animal becomes disobedient
and on the defensive. Continued contact should be replaced by repeated contacts of short duration of an intensity to fit the case.</p>

<p>The length of the spur varies with the length of the
stirrup leathers, the length of the leg of the rider, and
the form of the horse. A general rule is that the spur
should be of such a length as to be easily used without danger of unintentional usage during sudden displacements.</p>

<center> The Reins.</center>

<p>In the training of the horse the reins should be held
in two hands. Single reins should be held as prescribed
in the Cavalry Drill Regulations.</p>

<p>The following important rule should always be observed: The pressure of the rider's legs, or of his heels,
must always precede any action of the hand; in other
words, the bit does not go back to the horse, but the horse
goes forward against the bit.</p>

<p>It has been shown that by the action of the legs impulsion is produced in the horse, which causes a stretching of the neck to the front in order to begin or accelerate the forward movement. If as the head and neck
stretch out the forward movement of the bit in the mouth
is arrested by the hand, the bit is brought into stronger
contact with the bars of the mouth, which produces its
action. The action of the reins is thus produced after
the action of the legs has produced its effect.</p>

<center>Kinds of Reins. (De Saint-Phalle.)</center>
<p><em>Open Rein.</em> &mdash; This rein is used in turning the horse.
The right rein, for example, is said to be open if the
right hand is carried to the right and front. Reins are
so used for the particular effect they have upon the
horse's head. The need of them is felt especially in the
training of green horses, but also with a horse that refuses to turn and carries his head in the opposite direction from that in which the rider desires him to go.
When the right rein is open, the horse's head will be
drawn to the right and he will be assisted in moving in
that direction.</p>

<p><em>Direct Rein.</em> &mdash; This rein acts parallel to the axis of
the horse without intermediary action upon the neck.
Reins used in this manner bring a little of the weight to
the side on which they act, which with an obedient horse
suffices to make him turn to that side. It is also used
in turning the horse's head at the poll so that the horse
may look in the direction toward which he is going.</p>

<p><em>Rein of Support.</em> &mdash; The right rein, for example, is
called the right rein of support when the right hand
moves from right to left and the right rein hence bears
against the neck. It has different effects according to
the point towards which its action is directed. For example,
if the hand is moved towards the front of or over
the left shoulder, the effect is to bring the weight of the
forehand towards that shoulder; or if the direction of
the right rein of support passes in rear of the withers,
the effect is felt by the increased weight on the left
haunch; or if the action of the rein in this direction is
sufficiently strong, it can either lead to the displacement
of the haunches towards the left by setting the left
shoulder, or displace simultaneously the shoulders and
the haunches towards the left by pushing the horse entirely to that side.</p>

<p>The effect of the rein of support is extremely powerful in preventing the horse from slipping out on its side,
or in restraining the horse from turning in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p><em>Rein of Opposition.</em> &mdash; If the rider opens the right
rein slightly and pulls either in the direction of the right
haunch or the direction of the left haunch, the rein is
called the right rein of opposition. He is then said to
set the shoulders in opposition to the haunches. (Notes
d'Equitation.)</p>

<p><em>General Rule:</em>&mdash; A general rule is, that at all times
contact is kept with the mouth by the reins through the
medium of the bit. The reins never flop. There are
two exceptions to this rule allowable: during complete
abandon, as at the walk; and momentarily, during flexions, as will be shown later.</p>

<p></em>The Seat.</em> &mdash; The seat is an aid when it changes the
support of the body from one buttock to the other to
assist the horse in lateral movements. This movement
helps to carry the center of gravity of the horse to the
side toward which the movement is desired. Similarly
an increase in the weight placed on one stirrup is an aid.
The upper part of the body by leaning forward or
back likewise assists the horse in moving the center of
gravity forward and back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>The Forward Movement.</h3>

<p>The horses being now able to be mounted, the following exercises may be undertaken:</p>

<p>The horses are taken into the riding-hall, if available,
and the riders instructed to work without regard to distances. It is a bad plan to work in groups, especially
with young horses, as they soon become accustomed to
remaining in ranks and refuse to leave.</p>

<p>The forward movement, as has been stated, is the
most important lesson in training, and it is continually
taught during the entire course of instruction.</p>

<p><em>The Walk.</em> &mdash; To take the walk from the halt, both
legs should be made to be felt, gradually increasing their
intensity until the setting in motion is produced. The
fingers and wrists give, to allow the neck to stretch out.
The horse should be set in motion in the direction of his axis by symmetrical use of the aids. The movement
should be smooth, but without hesitancy.</p>

<p>In order to keep the start from being sudden, the
energy displayed in the use of the leg should conform to
the degree of sensitiveness of the horse. The movement
can be kept from being hesitatingly performed by progressively, but without hesitancy, using such force as the
legs should have, and by giving the reins with the fingers
and wrist at the precise moment the neck tries to
stretch out.</p>

<p><em>The Trot.</em> &mdash; This is the most advantageous gait to
take during the first lessons, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It starts the horse straight ahead and helps to
bring him in hand.</li>
  <li>'Horses are less restless at this gait.</li>
  <li>It is a natural pace.</li>
  <li>It is a good suppling exercise for the horse.
The trot is not a fatiguing pace to the horse. He
can go a long distance continuously at a fair rate of
speed at this gait, because both fore and hind legs, respectively, have the same amount of work to do, and the
body can be easily maintained in a state of equilibrium,
as it is supported by diagonal supports.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rider, if in the flat saddle, except at slow gaits,
should rise to the trot during this exercise. The diag-
onal on which the rise is made should frequently be
changed.</p>

<p>The lightness of the horse only comes with further
training. The rider up to this point tries little by lit-
tle to bring the horse under control by the following
exercises :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moving to the front at a walk, then a trot.</li>
  <li>Increasing and decreasing gaits.</li>
  <li>Halting.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To Halt.</em> &mdash; To execute this movement, lean back
slightly and gradually increase the pressure of the bit
on the mouth until the movement slows down and gradually steps. Roth legs should at the same time be carried
back to assist the horse in bringing the haunches up under
him. The horse should neither raise nor lower his head.
The whole mass of the neck should move toward the
withers.</p>

<p>Halting the horse should often be practiced with
horses possessing a high, powerful croup and with those
inclined to forge ahead at all times. Those inclined to
fret, those whose legs are well set up under them, and
those that are difficult to keep up into the bit should seldom be halted.</p>

<p>Especially during these lessons must the rider pay
strict attention to the even tension of the rein. At first
the rider must do all the work — that is, must tighten the
reins; but later, the horse having become accustomed to
the pressure of the bit and always having the idea of going straight ahead, will of his own accord keep the reins
taut.</p>

<p><em>The Gallop.</em> &mdash; Almost invariably the gallop lesson
should be begun early. This is an additional means of
suppling the horse, of strengthening him, extending him,
and pushing him straight ahead. It would be stupidity
to gallop frequently on a colt that drags his legs and is
disunited at a trot and that has difficulty in holding up
the part essential to the training. On the other hand,
it is proper to gallop repeatedly on a vigorous horse that
has been worked before purchase, or on the horse with
good strong legs, particularly after he has been thorough-
ly confirmed in the correct trot. <i>(Notes d'Equitation.)</i></p>

<p><em>To Take the Gallop by Extending the Trot.</em> &mdash; To accomplish this movement, the rider needs only to take the
trot and by the use of both legs to push this gait up to
the point where the horse leaves it to pass into the gallop.</p>

<p>To accomplish this without undue increase of speed,
put the horse on a circle of six or seven yards radius,
first trot around this and then lengthen the trot until the
horse escapes into the gallop. When he is calm and the
rider feels confidence in himself, the rider may leave the
circle and rejoin the track on the same hand.</p>

<p>As long as the rider does not wish to make abrupt
changes of direction, but gallops on a large circle or on
the track, it makes little difference whether the horse is
galloping true or false, and it is useless for the rider to
bother about the leads at this stage of the training. <i>(De
Saint-Phalle.)</i></p>

<p>When the horse begins to understand the gallop and
takes it calmly, the correct lead, which is explained on
page 61, may be undertaken, at present, by the following
aids: Both legs to increase the gait from the trot to the
gallop; outside rein to prevent the haunches from swinging to the outside and which precludes the liability to a
false lead.</p>

<p><em>(Note. &mdash; "Outside" always means the outside of a
circle, or, if on the track, the side towards the wall.)</em></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>Mechanism of the Gaits.</h3>

<p><em>The Walk.</em> &mdash; This is a movement of four beats, and is a pace in which all the legs move, respectively, one after the other. If, for instance, the left fore leads, the sequence is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Left fore.</li>
  <li>Right hind.</li>
  <li>Right fore.</li>
  <li>Left hind.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the near hind begins, it will be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Left hind.</li>
  <li>Left fore.</li>
  <li>Right hind.</li>
  <li>Right fore.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each foot comes to the ground after the one that
precedes it at an interval of about half the time occupied taking one step. The result of this is that we have the
following order of supports:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right laterals (right fore and right hind).</li>
  <li>Right diagonals (right fore and left hind).</li>
  <li>Left laterals.</li>
  <li>Left diagonals.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a rule, a horse begins the walk with a fore leg.
<em>(Hayes.)</em></p>

<p><em>The Trot.</em> &mdash; This is a movement of two beats. The diagonal feet are on the ground at the same time. The order of supports is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right diagonal.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
  <li>Left diagonal.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>The Pace.</em> &mdash; This is a movement of two beats, like the trot, except the support is by the laterals instead of the diagonals. The order of supports is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right lateral.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
  <li>Left lateral.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>The Gallop.</em> &mdash; The gallop is an unsymmetrical gait of three beats. It is called unsymmetrical because the two front legs make dissimilar movements, likewise the two hind. Two different combinations take place, which are called 'gallop right'' and "gallop left." The moment of taking each new point of support is called a beat.</p>
<p>In the gallop right the points of support are taken in the following order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Left hind.</li>
  <li>Left diagonal (left front, right hind).</li>
  <li>Right front.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
</ol>

<p>The gallop left is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right hind.</li>
  <li>Right diagonal (right front, left hind).</li>
  <li>Left front.</li>
  <li>Moment of suspension.</li>
<ol>

<p>A horse galloping right, for instance, seems to have the right legs always in front of the left. The rider can tell by seeing if the right shoulder is further advanced than the left. If the horse gallops right in front and left behind, the rider can feel an unusual stiff movement be-neath him.</p>

  <H2>CHAPTER V.</H2>

  <center>Changes of Direction.</center>

  <p>The horse being able to move forward and to decrease and increase gaits with reasonable accuracy,
  changes of direction may be undertaken.</p>

  <p><em>First Exercise.</em> &mdash; The horse being at the walk, force
  the horse forward with both legs, use the open rein, and
  i{ he moves off at an angle oblique to the original direction, although the divergence may be small, it is
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p><em>Second Exercise.</em> &mdash; The horse being at the walk, use
  the right or left leg to help carry the haunches around
  to the left or right; use the right or left rein of opposition to turn the horse to the right or left in a direction
  perpendicular to the original. The rein of opposition is
  used to combat the haunches with the shoulder. The
  horse cot yet knowing the meaning of the preponderant
  use of one leg of the rider, the shoulder combating the
  haunch will make the haunch swing around, and if the
  horse, every time he is obliged to swing his haunches
  by the rein of opposition, feels the rider's leg on that
  side, he will begin to associate the use of the leg with the
  swinging of the haunches.</p>

  <p><em>Third Exercise.</em> &mdash; As the horse begins to understand the meaning of the use of one leg, gradually lessen
  the use of the rein of opposition as an open rein, until
  it finally becomes a direct rein, used only to turn the head
  slightly in the new direction. As the rein of opposition,
  or open rein, is diminished, supposing it to have been the
  right rein, gradually bring into play the left rein of support to force the fore quarters to the right in the new
  direction. As to the legs: Have both ready to maintain the impulsion, and each ready to act singly in case
  the hind feet do not follow in the track of the fore feet
  in making the change of direction. The hind legs being
  the propellers, and the maximum of power being always
  desirable, for purely mechanical reasons the greatest
  power of the hind legs is obtained when they follow in
  the same path as the forelegs, during turns.</p>

  <p><em>(Note.</em> &mdash; The third exercise should not be undertaken
  until the horse has accomplished most of the exercises
  of Lateral Equitation, explained in following chapters.)</p>

<p>  Abouts, circles, figures of eight, and serpentines are
  exercises, named in order of difficulty, which may be undertaken to accomplish the same result as the above
  exercises, with greater exactness. All these exercises
  should be practiced at the walk until proficient before
  attempting them at the slow trot. The rider sits the
  blow trot.</p>

  <p><em>The About on the Forehand at a Halt.</em> &mdash; With
  horses that are naturally impulsive and are continually
  endeavoring to forge to the front, abouts on the forehand
  from the halt may be practiced at this stage of the training. With horses of exaggerated impulsiveness it may
  sometimes be undertaken earlier. The exercise should
  come later for less impulsive horses. The movement
  should always be completed by moving the horse straight
  to the front. The about on the forehand should always
  be about the inside leg as a pivot, for otherwise the movement is a retrograde one and tends to put the horse behind the bit.</p>

  <p>It must be understood that at this stage of training,
  that is, during lateral equitation (explained on page 50),
  the about on the forehand is not a finished movement.
  The aids to be used are: To execute an about on the
  forehand to the right; both legs to arouse impulsion; the
  right leg to swing the haunches ; the right rein of opposition to assist the right leg; the left rein to assist the
  right in its second function of preventing the horse from
  moving forward. The left leg is always ready to prevent the horse from backing.</p>

<p><em>About on the Forehand (Dismounted).</em> &mdash; With some
  horses that are particularly difficult to teach the use of
  the leg as an aid, dismounted work may be resored to.
  Short lessons only should be given.</p>

<p>Working on the left side, seize the reins six or eight
  inches from the bit in the left hand. Stand facing the
  horse and with the riding-whip touch him in rear of the
  girth where the rider's leg would ordinarily come when
  used as an aid. Increase the force of the whip, beginning with light taps, until the horse swings his haunches
  away from the whip. The left hand prevents the horse
  moving either forward or backward. If at first the
  horse fails to move his haunches, he may be assisted in
  doing so by bringing the head slightty toward the side
  of the trainer. This opposes the head to the haunches
  and assists the action of the whip.</p>

  <hr/>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<h2><center> CHAPTER. VI.</center></h2>


<center>Outdoor Work.</center>

<p>From the moment the horse will go straight ahead
outdoor work is in some cases a necessity and in all cases
to a greater or less extent desirable. </p>

<p>Horses which tend to get behind the bit or which do
not let themselves out should frequently have outside
work alternated with hall work. The horse being grad-
ually educated to a good free trot should be given them
outdoors, allowing time enough between trots for the
horse to assume normal breathing. Outdoor work should
take place with normal horses two days a week.</p>

<p>All horses need fresh outdoor air occasionally.</p>

<p>Horses that are inclined to bolt or forge ahead con-
tinually, or those that throw most of the weight on the
forehand, need much more hall work than outdoor work.</p>

<p>Young horses especially should be given trots on
soft ground. No horse should be galloped on hard roads.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Soft ground means turf or dirt roads, not plowed land
or stone-built roads. The gallop is undertaken outdoors
only when the horse can be made to lead from either foot.</p>

<p>By going in pairs nervous horses do not fret while
outdoors, as much as though alone. It is likewise bet-
ter not to maintain a formation in ranks while outdoors,
any more than necessary, in order to prevent the new
horses from acquiring the habit of going in ranks and
refusing to leave.</p>

<p>During the last part of outdoor exercise the horse
should be walked so that he is returned to the stable
breathing normally.</p>

<h2><center>CHAPTER VII.</center></h2>



<center> Suppling Exercises with Body Bent.</center>

<p><em>Different Kinds of Equitation.</em> &mdash; When, for example,
the right rein and right leg are used to assist each other
in moving the haunches, it is called lateral equitation.
When the reins place the forehand and the legs alone
control the hindhand, as, for example, if the left rein and
right leg are used, it is called diagonal equitation.</p>

<center>Lateral Equitation.</center>

<p>The following points should he considered during
the exercises in lateral equitation :
<ol>
<li> One step taken correctly is at first all that should
be expected or required.</li>

<li> As the movements are fatiguing, they should at
no time be continued more than a few seconds.</li>

<li> Horses that are stiff on one particular side
should be suppled by exercises to that side.</li>


<li> The preceding rule applies to all parts of the
horse except the neck. If the neck is stiff on the right
side, supple it by exercises, as ''Shoulder In" (see below).
on the left hand. <em>(Capt. Short.)</em></li>

<li> The movements are all begun at a walk and
when proficient in them, are executed at a slow trot.</li>

<li> When the movements are executed on a circle,
where the fore quarters are on one circumference and the
hind quarters either on a larger or a smaller circumfer-
ence, the effect, besides being one of suppling, is as fol-
lows: When the haunches are on a smaller circumfer-
ence the horse tends toward collection, his hind quarters
tend to come up under the body, and it is a good move-
ment for a horse that forges ahead ; when the hind quart-
ers are on a circle of greater circumference than the fore
quarters the horse tends to be forced up into the bit and
to stretch out behind, hence it is a useful movement with
sluggish horses or horses that tend to get behind the bit.</li>

<li> When executing any of the following exercises,
if the horse fails to respond to the action of both legs
and does not go up into the bit, cease the exercise at once
and move straight ahead at a trot or gallop and do not
return to the exercise until the horse is again into the bit.</li>

</ol>

<p><em>First Exercise in Suppling the Haunches.</em> &mdash; This les-
son consists in abouts on the forehand while marching.
For example, marching on the right hand, leave the track
on a diagonal (oblique) and return to it by a half turn to
the left exacted by a very pronounced action of the left
leg and left rein. This strongly marked lateral effect
carries the horse's haunches to the right ; that is to say.
the horse while still gaining ground yields to the effect
of the leg (and left rein), and thus describes a half turn.
The same movement is executed while marching on the
left hand and the horse eventually swings the haunches
easily about the forehand, without halting, without strik-
ing the fetlocks, and without dancing. (<em>Notes d'Equi-
tation.</em>)</p>

<p>The commands for this exercise are:</p>
<ol>
<li> Right oblique.</li>

<li> <em>March.</em></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li> On forehand.</li>

<li> Half turn in reverse.</li>

<li> <em>March</em>.</li>


</ol>
<hr/>


<p>"Half turn" and "reverse" could, in this case, be
expressed "left half turn," but "in reverse" has partic-
ular significance, and the terms should be retained on that
account.</p>

<p><em>Haunches In.</em> &mdash; This movement is one to exact obe-
dience to one leg while marching. It continues the sup-
pling of the hind quarters and confirms the obedience
to the leg. It should be undertaken only when the horse
yields readily to the legs in previous exercises.</p>

<p>Marching on the right hand, use the left rein of op-
position and the left leg. It is sufficient if the horse
swings his haunches to the right so that the left hind foot
steps on a line passing through the prints of the right fore
foot. The left rein of opposition assists the action of
the left leg. At first one step is sufficient to demand at
a time. Repeat the movement several times, gradually
demanding more steps in the correct position. Never de-
mand the movement, at any one time, over a greater dis-
tance than the long side of the riding hall. The follow-
ing cautions should be carefully observed:</p>



<hr/>
<ol>
<li> Never let the horse's body make an angle of
more than 45 degrees with the original direction. To
prevent this, use the inside leg.</li>

<li> Never let the gait diminish. To prevent this,
use both legs when necessary to demand impulsion.</li>

<li> Do not lean to the left when moving to the right.
The weight of the body should be slightly more upon the
right buttock when moving to the right.</li>

<li> Do not let the right rein be slack when moving
to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Shoulder In.</em> &mdash; This is a similar exercise to haunches
in, but more difficult and more useful.</p>

<p>This movement supples both forehand and hindhand.</p>

<p>To execute the movement when marching on the
right hand:</p>

<p>First use the right open rein and the left rein of
support, the fore quarters are then moved off the track
and the head turned to the right ; the right leg is then used
to push the mass from right to left and the left leg to
receive the swinging of the haunches and to control the
impulsion.</p>


<hr/>

<p><em>Cautions to Be Observed:</em></p>
<ol>
<li> During the first lessons, after the fore quarters
have been moved off the track, to facilitate the movement
along the track, the outside rein may be slightly opened.</li>

<li> The reins prevent the lateral flexion of the neck
at the shoulders by holding the head firmly between them.</li>

<li> The fore quarters are sufficiently removed from
the track if the left fore foot and right hind travel along
the same path parallel to the track.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Diagonal Equitation.</p>

<p>Exercises with Body Straight.</p>

<p><em>General Rules for Diagonal Equitation:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Perfection is gained when the body of the horse: from the poll back is in a straight line.</li>
  <li>The horse's head is always turned slightly at the poll to enable him to see in the direction he is going.</li>
  <li>The reins set or place the forehand.</li>
  <li>The legs govern the hindhand.</li>
  <li>The green horse is never passaged directly to the right or left. The direction of motion should not be more than 45 degrees from the direction of the axis of the horse.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Work on Two Tracks.</em> &mdash; This movement consists in

displacing the horse parallel to himself in a direction ob lique to that of his axis, the front and hind legs describing four parallel tracks. The exterior members cross over the interior ones.</p>

<p>The following are the aids in order to move a horse on two tracks to the right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Both legs, if sufficient momentum is not already obtained, should send the horse up into the bit to receive the indications of the reins.</li>
  <li>The right direct rein makes the horse look to the side toward which he should march, and by throwing the weight slightly to the right begins the displacement of the center of gravity towards the right.- The left rein of support acts at the same time as the preceding, to in-sure the lateral displacement of the forehand to the right by further displacing the center of gravity.</li>
  <li>The left leg, at this moment, becomes prepond-erant in order to direct the haunches to the right, while the right leg acts if necessary to limit the displacement of the haunches, and to oblige the horse to maintain his gait and to gain ground to the front as well as to the side.</li>
  <li>The seat is displaced towards the right to aid the horse's movement to that side. <em>(De Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The following are exercises on two tracks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks, Haunches In.</em> &mdash; A two-track movement along the track, with the head to the wall, in which the haunches move on an inside track, the horse heing in the position described above for the work on two tracks and being governed by similar aids.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks, Haunches Out.</em> &mdash; Same as above, except the croup is to the wall and the fore quarters move on an inside track, the hind quarters on the track.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks on the Diagonal.</em> &mdash; A movement in which a horse moves across the hall on the diagonal on two tracks.</li>
  <li><em>On Two Tracks on a Circle.</em> &mdash; Described by its name. The haunches being on a smaller or larger circle than the fore quarters. The same principles apply in each case as described for work on two tracks.</li>
</ol>

<p><Center>Commands.</Center></p>
<p><em>For First Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches in.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Second Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches out.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Third Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Right oblique.</li>
  <li>March.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>For Fourth Exercise.</em> &mdash; </p>

<ol>
  <li>On two tracks.</li>
  <li>Haunches in (or out).</li>
  <li>March. <em>(Footnote to Saummur Notes.)</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>About on the Forehand at a Halt.</em> &mdash; To execute this movement from left to right the aids are as folows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Carry the weight of the mass over the shoulders by the equal action of both legs.</li>
  <li>Just the horse is about to move out, close the fingers on the reins and prevent further advance.</li>
  <li>Use the right rein of support to bring the weight upon the left shoulder.</li>
  <li>Use the left direct rein to turn the horse's head to the left at the poll.</li>
  <li>Use the left leg to move the haunches to the right.</li>
  <li>The right leg remains ready to maintain the advanced position of the center of gravity and likewise to limit the movement of the haunches to that side.</li>
  <li>The seat should be carried to the right to facil-itate the displacement of the haunches to that side.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>About on the Haunches.</em> &mdash; This movement is more difficult than the about on the forehand and should be undertaken only after the work on two tracks is well understood.</p>

<p>The movement is first taught by moving the horse on two tracks on a small circle; for example, to the right, with haunches in.</p>

<p>Gradually decrease the diameter of the circle as the horse becomes proficient. As the circle becomes smaller change the direction of the rein so that the direction of the pull is toward the right haunche to weight the latter d wn. Likewise increase the pressure of the left leg un-til it is sufficient to prevent little by little any movement on the part of the haunches. The circle then is finally diminished so that the movement is that of a circle on the part of the forehand about the right hind leg as a
pivot. If the movement should be about the left hind leg, or outside leg, as a pivot, it becomes a retrograde movement, which is liable to put the horse behind the bit.</p>

<p><em>The Gallop.</em> &mdash; Heretofore the gallop has been undertaken merely as a means cf exercise tj strengthen and stretch out the hone and to teach him a little in balanc-ing himself by the use of his legs. No attention was paid at first to the leads; later a little lateral equitation was used to partially insure the correct lead.</p>

<p>A horse is leading correctly when the right laterals (right front and right hind) are in advance of the left laterals, when turning to the right. This is called "lead-ing right." A horse is galloping disunited when he is galloping one way in front and another way in rear.</p>

<p>On small circles or sudden turns of direction a horse is liable to fall if not leading correctly.</p>

<p><em>The Right Lead.</em> &mdash; To require a horse to lead to the right, the aids are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Weight of the body to the left, weight in left stirrup in order to weight down the left haunch.</li>
  <li>Use of the left leg to cause the haunches to be displaced to the right, consequently requiring the right lateral to pass the left.
  <li>Use of the right leg to join its action to that of the left to give the necessary impulsion and to receive the haunches and prevent their being moved too far to the right. The horse being driven by the legs up into the bit, is received by the reins in the following manner:</li>
  <li>Right rein of support exerted in a direction to-ward the left shoulder to weight the latter, for it must be slowed down ; at the same time this movement frees the right shoulder and allows it to extend itself. The horse is made to slightly turn the head to the right at the poll in order that he may see in the direction in which he is going.</li>
  <li>Left direct rein corroborates the action of the right and keeps the neck straight. </em>(De Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>
  <li>If the gallop is taken from the trot while post-ing, rising with the right diagonal assists the right lead. Rising from the left diagonal assists the left lead.
  When perfection is attained, the horse does not perceptibly swing his haunches to the right or left.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p><small><em>*Note.</em> &mdash; For paragraphs 4 and 5 the following paragraphs, showing a method of using the reins, may he substituted. This method is taught by some of the best authorities in our service. It certainly can be reasoned out as well as that mentioned above, it is more easy to put in practice and produces results in a scientific manner.</small></p>
<small>
<ol>
  <li>Use the left direct rein to weight the left Shoulder.</li>
  <li>Exert sufficient pressure on the right rein to keep the head from being turned to the left, so that the horse may see where he is going, and at the same time raise the right hand slightly to assist in lightening the weight on the right shoulder, thereby assisting to free it.</li>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>Backing.</h3>

<p>This exercise is a suppling one for back and haunches, and is especially applicable to horses who have difficulty in bringing the hind legs under the body. It is an
exercise which to the unskillful is dangerous, as it tends
to put a horse behind the bit. To the skillful it is of
course less dangerous, yet it should not be undertaken
by either until this point in the education of the horse
is reached, provided he be normal. With horses that are
very difficult to hold, or are continually b king, backing
exercises may be undertaken earlier in the training. </p>

<p>The movement may be advantageously taught distincted at first.</p>

<p><em>Teaching the Backward Movement, Dismounted.</em> &mdash;
The trainer stands facing the horse. He takes the reins
one in each hand and slightly lowers the head to relieve
the weight on the hind quarters. He then makes a slight
movement with his hands towards his own body, sufficient to prepare the horse to move forward. As the
horse is about to move out the trainer presses directly
toward the horse with the bit until the horse takes a step
to the rear. One step at first is sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few lessons of this, the trainer steps to the
left side of the horse, with the reins in the left hand, the
riding-whip in the right. He stimulates the hind quarters with a light touch of the whip, and as the horse starts
to move his iiind quarters up under his body he urges
him to take a step to the rear by the pressure of the bit.
As soon as he takes a step or two as desired, he leads him
forward.</p>

<p><em>Mounted.</em> &mdash; When the horse can perform the last
exercise well, mount him. Use the aids required to
move the horse to the front; then, just as he is about to
move out, increase the pressure of the reins and lean
slightly back until the horse steps to the rear. As soon
as the horse at first has taken a single step to the rear he
should be moved straight to the front. Later several
steps to the rear may be required, but a movement to the
front always follows the last step. If difficulty is at any
time encountered in moving the horse forward after the
backward movement, backing should cease as an exercise
until the horse is sent up into the bit again.</p>

<p>If the horse sets himself, move him forward a step
or two, and as he is moving exert the aids for the backward movement until he obeys. Moving a horse's
haunches laterally will help to prevent a horse from setting himself and refusing to back.</p>

<p>This exercise should not be repeated often in a single day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<h4>The Double Bridle.</h4>

<p>The horse that can perform successfully the fore-
going exercises, that has found his balance while moving
forward, that is easy to control by the aids at the walk
and trot, and that has learned the use of his legs in ac-
complishing a good walk, trot, and gallop, is ready for
the double bridle. It normally takes about three months
to accomplish this.</p>

<p><em>Definition.</em> &mdash; The double bridle is one with usually
four cheek straps, which fasten, one into the eye of the
curb bit, the other into the ring of the snaffle bit.</p>

<p>The curb bit is nearer the front of the horse's mouth
than the snaffle, and the curb chain likewise passes in
front of the snaffle bit.</p>


<p><em>The Severity of the Curb Bit Increases &mdash; </em></p>
<ol>
<li> With the difference between the length of the
upper and lower branches.</li>

<li> With the tightness of the curb chain.</li>

<li> With the height of the port.</li>

<li> Inversely With the size of the canons. <em>(De
Saint-Phalle.)</em></li>

</ol>

<p>Bits with branches similar in length to the U. S. rej-
ulation bit are arranged below in order of mildness:</p>

<ol>

<li> The broken curb bit. (Like a snaffle bit, but
with upper and lower branches and curb chain.)</li>

<li> Rubber- and leather-covered bits.</li>

<li> The straight bar bit.</li>

<li> The regulation bit. </li>

</ol>

<p><em>Kinds.</em> &mdash; The "Weymouth" or "Pump" bit is quite
universally used for polo. Why it is considered effica-
cious for polo especially is not known. It is a good bit,
except the lips are liable to become pinched.</p>

<p>The "Pelham" is a bit provided with rings for the
snaffle rein at the junction of the canon with the branch-
es. The action of the curb reins on this bit does not
produce the same effect, when the snaffle reins are used
at the same time, as it does on a curb bit, where the snaf-
fle reins are attached to a separate snaffle bit.</p>

<p>It is a general rule to follow, that all complicated
bits are useless, and that with a well-trained horse the
mildest bit that will insure obedience is the correct one.</p>

<h3>Schedule for Accustoming the Horse to the
Curb Bit.</h3>

<p>The reins are held in both hands, snaffle reins out-
side the little fingers.</p>
<ol>

<li> Use the curb bit without curb chain until the
horse becomes accustomed to it.</li>

<li>Use the mildest bit available and fasten the curb
chain loosely. At first, only move on straight lines until
the horse takes the bit quietly, then execute simple ex-
ercises in which the horse is proficient. These exercises
at first are begun on the snaffle bit.</li>

<li>Use the bit best adapted to the horse, and set
the curb chain to keep the bit from falling through.</li>

</ol>

<p>Work mainly on the snaffle bit until the horse becomes
accustomed to the bit and curb chain.</p>

<p>The preceding movements should be begun at first
at a slow gait.</p>

<p><em>Use.</em> — The curb bit is used primarily, in training, to
lower the head, to flex the jaw, and to bring the nose in
towards the body.</p>

<p>The snaffle bit raises the head and supports the horse.</p>

<p>A curb bit will not stop a horse that makes up his to bolt.</p>

<p>A curb bit roughly used may cause a horse to make
up his mind to bolt.</p>

<p>A "hard mouth" is often a tender mouth accustomed
to hard hands.</p>

<p><em>The Curb Bit ''Gathers'' the Horse.</em> &mdash; A horse is
gathered when his head and neck are well raised, the
front line of the face nearly vertical, and the jaw and
the junction of the head and neck at the poll flexible.</p>

<p>A horse in a state of "collection" is in a position to
obey, to the utmost of his capability, any demands the aids
may give.</p>


<p>A horse is in "collection" when he is gathered and
his hind legs are well up under the body.</p>

<p>When a horse is collected, the rider, by having omit-
ted bending the neck near the shoulders during training,
has the neck firm on the shoulders and not flexible or
"rubber-necked." Hence the rider acts on the neck
through the mouth and on the shoulders through the
neck. The hind quarters by being under the horse bind
themselves to the forehand. The rider then by acting
on the forehand acts likewise upon the hind quarters.</p>

<p>The entire body of the horse should be, if properly
collected, an energetic and harmonious whole. The
horse is "in hand," because his jaw is flexible and he
yields to the effects of the bit. The horse is light or
handy, because he is balanced by continual training and
because his center of gravity is equally near both front
and hind quarters; hence the proper movement on the
part of the rider will disturb this balance in any direc-
tion desired.</p>

<p>The rider at this point, being supposed to be able to
get the hind legs up under the horse, must learn to gath-
er him.</p>


<p>To gather the horse involves:</p>
<ol>

<li> Direct flexion (the flexion of the jaw and head
in the direction of the axis of the horse).</li>

<li> Lateral flexion (the flexion of the neck at the
poll in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the horse).</li>

</ol>
<p> <em>Direct Flexion.</em> &mdash; Direct flexion is the concession the
head and lower jaw of the horse make in the vertical
plane of the axis of the horse when the action of the
reins arrest the extension of the neck. The giving of the
neck is confined to the upper portion; the front line of
the face is made to approach a vertical line and the head
is made to make in an almost imperceptible manner a
movement analogous to a nod. </p>

<p>The giving of the jaw consists in opening the mouth,
causing complete abandon of the bit, followed immediate
ly by the closing of the mouth and the taking up of con-
tact with the bit again.</p>

<p>To flex the jaw in direct flexion, first start the horse
into a walk. Never let the gait slacken during flexion.
Close the legs. When the horse goes up into the bit,
close one hand on one snaffle rein I if the movement is
done with a snaffle bit), or close the hand on both curb
reins. Do not make the pressure of long duration if re-
sistance is encountered. Alternate the action, first by
releasing, then increasing the pressure. This is more
uncomfortable to the horse than continued pressure, and
he will soon yield.</p>

<p>The head is flexed in direct flexion so that it is set
with the front line of the face nearly vertical by the action
of both curb reins. The head and neck are raised by the
snaffle bit, should they be lowered too much.</p>

<p><em>Lateral Flexion.</em> &mdash; Lateral flexion is a concession
which the head and neck make by turning the head to
the right or to the left when an opposing action of the
reins stops an extension of the neck. The jaw gives
in lateral flexion as in direct flexion. The neck gives by
making the head make a turn of a quarter of a circle to
the right or left at the poll.</p>

<p>Lateral flexion should be demanded, in the begin-
ning, at the walk. To obtain it, to the right, for exam-
ple: first, resistance must be offered by the right direct
rein, which leads the head into the desired position; the
left rein then acts to limit this movement and to work
together with the right rein to obtain the concession oi
the jaw.</p>

<p>Flexion may be made dismounted, if absolutely im-
possible of execution mounted.</p>

<p><em>Direct Flexion Dismounted. </em> &mdash; Stand on the near side
of the horse. Take the snaffle reins off the neck over
the horse's head and hold them a few inches in front of
his head with the left hand. Urge the horse forward
into a walk and raise the head sightly to the proper ele-
vation with the snaffle reins : When the horse moves out
at the walk, take the curb reins in the right hand and as-
similate the movement of the reins as though flexing the
jaw mounted. Do not let the horse slacken speed or, at
any cost, back up.</p>

<p><em>Lateral Flexion Dismounted. </em> &mdash; Stand on the near
side, with the snaffle rein held as for direct flexion. Ex-
ecute direct flexion and when performed lead the horse's
head to the right with a snaffle rein, increasing the pres-
sure of the right curb rein slightly until the head is turned
to the right at the poll. Do not let the horse move back-
ward, nor let the neck flex in rear of the poll. The max-
imum movement of the head is over an arc of a circle
of 90 degrees.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p> <center>The Change of Lead at the Gallop.</center> </p>

<p>This movement is to be undertaken when the horse is capable of taking the desired lead from a trot on a straight line.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put the horse on a circle of large radius, at a galiop. Leave the circle by a line parallel to the diagonal of the riding&mdash;hall and form another large circle to the opposite hand, keeping the same lead at the gallop as on the first circle. Galloping on the second circle with the same lead as on the first is galloping "false." Besides lowering the croup and balancing the horse, the false lead impresses the aids upon the horse, because to maintain a false lead the aids used &mdash; on the first circle must be more strongly used on the second.</li>
  <li>Gallop the horse on a straight line, leading right. Bring him down to a trot, previously having changed the aids to gallop left, which assists in bringing the horse to the trot and prepares the way for the next move. As soon as the trot is taken, increase the aids of gallop left, increase the impulsion, and send the horse into gallop left, with only a few steps of the trot intervening between gallops. Gradually, as the horse becomes proficient, decrease the number of steps taken at the trot.</li>
  <li>When the amount of trot required between changes of lead is hardly more than a slackening of speed, or "half halt," make a large circle to the right at the gallop, leading right. Leave the circle on the diagonal, as before, and make another circle to the left, holding the right lead. Change the aids, while on the second circle, to gallop left, without coming to the trot, and force the horse into the change of lead.</li>
  <li>When the horse can accomplish the above, attempt the change of aids and force the change of lead on the straight line without diminishing the gait.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above movements are very difficult to accomplish smoothly and correctly. The change of aids must not be accomplished roughly and the aids must be used with only the intensity required to change the lead, thereby not forcing the horse to increase of speed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<center>Jumping.</center>

<p>Jumping is an exercise which when properly undertaken is most instructive and productive of good results to both man and horse.</p>

<center>Mechanism of the Jump for Height.</center>

<center>(Jumping from the Gallop Left.)</center>

<ol>
  <li>As the left fore foot is about to leave the ground, just before the moment of suspension of the gallop, the leg, especially the fetlock joint, is straightened.</li>
  <li>The head and neck are elevated. The above movement raises the forehand.</li>
  <li>Just as the left foot is raised the two hind legs are brought up to a place on the ground about where the left fore foot was.</li>
  <li>The hind legs are straightened out. Due to the last movement, the horse completely
leaves the ground and takes the obstacle, with fore and hind legs bent.</li>
  <li>The horse lands on the left fore foot, legs straight.</li>
  <li>The right fore foot, leg straight, is then brought to the support.</li>
  <li>The left fore foot is picked up.</li>
  <li>The right fore foot is picked up and simultaneously the left hind comes to the ground.</li>
  <li>The right hind comes to the ground. The horse then is galloping right after landing. </li>
</ol>

<p>The horse leaps from a trot from one front leg and both hind legs. The leap is more difficult, as it is impossible at a trot to get both hind legs side by side up under the body to take off.</p>

<p>From the walk and halt, the horse in jumping first rears, then straightens out his hind legs.</p>

<p>As jumping for height at a gallop is the easiest for a horse, and as the principles encountered apply equally well to the other gaits, the following deductions are made from the mechanism at the gallop, as explained in previous paragraphs:</p>

<p>From Paragraph 1: As the distance from the jump to the place where the left leg leaves the ground is of the utmost importance to the horse, he should be allowed to gauge his stride while approaching the jump.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 2: As the head and neck are raised to assist in raising the fore quarters, the rider's body should not lean forward of the perpendicular, for this would hinder the movement. As the horse's object is to lighten the fore quarters, it follows that great speed is a detriment to a horse in jumping, for the more speed the more weight upon the forehand. Raising the head and neck necessitates lengthening the reins at the moment of extension, or letting them slide through the fingers. It follows then, that, as a false movement of the hand with a severe bit causes greater injury than one with a snaffle bit, a snaffle bit should be used in jumping until proficiency is obtained.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 3: To facilitate the bringing well up under the body of the hind leg, the rider's legs must be carried back.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 5: The weight of the rider's body must set to the rear to assist the horse by lightening the load on the forehand while landing. If a severe bit or a hard hand pulls the head in and bends the neck while the horse is in this position, by cramping the muscles of the neck the horse is prevented from stretching his legs to the front to insure a safe landing.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 7: If the rider's weight is forward or he is thrown upon the horse's neck while the horse is landing, the extra weight on the forehand prevents the fore leg being picked up and causes over-reaching. Ex-treme speed has the same effect with the same result.</p>

<p>From Paragraphs 8 and 9: It is seen that the horse is galloping with the other lead after landing. In jumping in the riding&mdash;hall care should be exercised at the corner beyond the jump if at the gallop, for, if galloping correctly at the start, the horse is galloping false after the jump.</p>

<p><em>Teaching the Horse to Jump.</em> &mdash; Place a bar upon the ground and lead the horse over it at a walk. When the horse executes this movement correctly, raise the bar to about two feet and jump the horse upon the longe.</p>

<p><em>To Jump a Horse on the Longe.</em> &mdash; First instruct the horse sufficiently upon the longe until he goes equally well on either hand. Approach the jump, the horse circling on the longe on the left hand, for instance. The trainer holds the longe in the left hand so that it can be allowed to run out with ease; the longeing-whip is held in the right hand. Circle the horse near the jump until the horse goes quietly. The circles are made slightly in rear of the jump. When the horse is quiet, move so that the jump will intercept the circle the horse is making. As the horse approaches the jump the trainer, with the longe fairly taut, likewise approaches the end of the bar nearest him, keeping the longeing-whip held in rear of the horse. Urge the horse with the whip, if necessary, until lie jumps. After taking off, let the longe run through the ringers so as not to yank the horse or bring him up short. When the horse does well, stop him and caress him or give him carrots or oats.</p>

<p>Jumping should be begun at first at the walk, then at the trot and gallop. The horse jumping for the first time gauges his stride more easily at the walk.</p>

<p>A bar may be placed two or three feet from the ground in the opening of the corral fence, etc., so that the horses that have been worked at jumping on the longe may be thus intercepted by an easy jump on their way to the corral or to some such place to which they are desirous of going. A man with a longeing whip stands ready to urge on any that refuse. This jump should be stiff and helps to prepare horses for outdoor jumping.</p>

<p><em>Riding the Horse Over the Jump.</em> &mdash; The horse being able to jump with sufficient accuracy, on the longe, is mounted. First, he is ridden over the bar on the ground. Then over the bar gradually raised to suit the horse.</p>

<p>On taking a horse up to the jump the following are essential points to remember:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rider must make up his mind that he is going to make the horse jump.</li>
  <li>He must have confidence in his balance and not stiffen his muscles.</li>
  <li>He must increase the grip with his knees and the calves of his legs and keep his hands low.</li>
  <li>The rider must have the horse well in hand and must remember that if a horse attempts to slip out to the left, the use of the right rein, to turn the head to the right, helps the horse to go to the left by freeing the left shoulder. The rein of support is the one which should be used, together with whichever leg will straighten the horse so that he is perpendicular to his jump.</li>
</ol>

<p>Horses are more easily controlled in the riding&mdash;hall, but jump with more freedom outdoors. Outdoor jumping should be taken up as soon as the horse learns to jump moderately well indoors.</p>

<p><em>Jumping for Breadth.</em> &mdash; This is a more difficult jump to teach a new horse, because he is more fearful of a ditch than of a fence. From the nature of the jump, it can only be taught outdoors. The method of instruction is the same as for jumping for height.</p>

<p>As the momentum acquired by speed is essential to carry the horse's body across an open ditch, greater speed is necessary than in jumping for height. Excessive speed, however, so weights down the forehand that it becomes difficult for the horse to raise his forehand sufficiently to clear the ditch.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Although all horses are different one from another,
the preceding rules generally apply. The rider who appreciates the needs of his horse is the one most likely to
succeed in training.</p>

<p>To many, the expenditure of six months in training
troop horses by these methods seems unnecessary and
impracticable. With experienced men and amenable
boises the time may be slightly reduced. A horse cannot be hurried, and slipshod, careless training is often
worse than none.</p>

<p>As it has been found entirely practical to follow out
this course with enlisted men on remounts at a regimental post, it is to be hoped that heavy, hard-gaited, uncomfortable horses to ride will soon disappear from the
ranks.</p>
